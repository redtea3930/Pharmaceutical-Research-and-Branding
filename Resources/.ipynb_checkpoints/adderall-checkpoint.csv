25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-07,adderall xr,Female,"I realize my previous comment was more about my personal journey with mental health rather than the facts/side effects of this medication (though I feel both are important). So as much as I’m happier with my life and thankful I have discovered this medication, I am going to get real about the side effects I’ve experienced. 

I currently take 2 20mg pills everyday. I take this medication in addition to 40mg Paxil/paroxetine to treat my combination of anxiety/depression/ADHD and I’ve noticed if I don’t take my Adderall, the paroxetine alone is not enough. 

As a coffee lover, I’ve learned that any more than one cup of coffee with this medication can make me feel jittery so I limit myself to no more than one cup a day. My blood pressure has also seemed to rise slightly while on this medication, though not enough to warrant any additional medication or treatment. (I’ve also struggled with being overweight my entire life and have recently experienced some weight gain so this could be the culprit as well.) I also can forget to eat while taking this medication so I have to make a conscious effort to eat a balanced breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Otherwise I can easily go an entire day without eating and scarf down a whole day’s worth of calories in one sitting once I get home from work. I‘ve also developed a dry mouth since taking this medication, something that my dentist pointed out, so I have to remember to drink enough water each day and use a toothpaste with fluoride. (I also take a daily antihistamine which does not help with the dryness.) My dentist also recommended I chew sugar free gum throughout the day. 

With all of this said, however, none of these side effects have been a dealbreaker for me or enough to raise serious concern from my doctor. After struggling to find something that works for me, I am ok with accepting these side effects in exchange for the vast improvement in my day to day life and mental health. Though everyone’s experience is different!"

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-08,adderall xr,Female,"My entire life I felt like I was different, never fit in with my peers, was weird and no one understood me. This came out as anger at myself, lashing out, feeling hopeless, worry, and low self esteem. Luckily school was easy, though I was always daydreaming in class, falling asleep at my desk, and overall unengaged. Still I always received high marks. College however was a rude awakening. I learned skating by without putting in much effort wasn’t going to cut it like it had before. I thought I may need to see a doctor but my own engrained fear & stigma around mental health was so strong I refused. “I don’t want to be controlled by a pill,” I thought. This would lead to 4 years struggling with school & maintaining relationships and masking my problems with alcohol.

Fast forward 2 years post-college, I was constantly tense & wound up inside and overall felt miserable & unmotivated with life. I FINALLY decided to reach out to my PCP. After trying multiple meds with no improvement and beginning to lose hope, I made an appt with a psychiatrist and it was the BEST decision I ever made. I was first prescribed Adderall and my life changed. 

Everything finally made sense. It was like something just clicked and I found the missing piece I’d been searching for. I had control over my brain, not the other way around. I could actually LISTEN when people spoke instead of lost in my own thoughts. I didn’t blurt out randomly and could actually think before I spoke. Most importantly I didn’t feel like I was broken anymore and was excited about life again.

Everyone’s mental health journey is unique and with everything there are side effects but please don’t be afraid to see if medication is right for you or let friends/family/society make you feel weak or ashamed for getting help. From reading others comments I realize addiction/abuse are very real but I wanted to add my positive experience so others like me aren’t scared to try something that could truly better their lives."

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-08,adderall xr, ,Been rx'd adhd meds since the 3rd grade. 20mg x 2 when I wake up. This has been the best by far for the longest too. Still have to be diligent in eating big breakfast bc no Appetite during day n blood sugar can drop but dnt have the crash after its worn off which many others can. Feels like it stays working steadily as it should from about 630am to 330-4pm. Does make ya have to #2 some mrngs when it first starts to kick in but nothing crazy. Important to take as prescribed or your sleep and eating will go downhill quick
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-10,adderall xr, ,"I was first prescribed 20mg Adderall Instant Release 3x daily and had bad headaches, lower-back pain and it was only effective for about 2-3 hrs. It almost quit working altogether over the course of the next couple weeks. The following month my doc put me on the 20mg XR twice daily and now I've not had any negative side effects except for occasional insomnia. I definitely recommend the XR over IR."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-20,adderall xr, , You are tempted to up the dosage as result of developing tolerance. I found it useful to reduce the dosage every few days or not take one at all. My biggest disappoint is that the XR doesn't extend the release that much slower than the standard pill. 
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-25,adderall xr,Male,**WARNING I wish I was givin**Worked well at first because It made me feel limitless literally  but soon it stopped working so I decided to make the worst decision of my life and up my dose. Of course I got that feeling again and fast forward 8 years later and multiple rehab trips  Iâ??m still battling adderall addiction.
35-44,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,2023-04-09,adderall xr,Female,"My dosage is 3-30mg (90mg) total daily in the morning....pharmacists always take a double look at the script cause supposedly my dosage is so high, its unheard of. Any ways it works great I've been on it for probably 5 years now and I do rely on a daily though and it's help me with my life tremendously"
65-74,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-05,adderall xr,Male,"Actually, my reason for taking this medication is that I have ADD. I'm not Hyperactive, but that was the only choice I was given. I am so glad that I was diagnosed and I was able to start this medication The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars for effectiveness is because I think that I should be on the next higher dose! Taking this medication has turned my life around. Before my ADD caused so many problems in my home life that my wife and I almost split up. I had a lot of problems finishing things that I started or remembering to do something because my mind would wander. Now I am able to stay on task and finish what I start. I only wish that I would have been diagnosed with this problem about 40 years ago. I wonder how it would have changed my working career?"
65-74,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,2023-01-11,adderall xr,Female,"I stay awake, but with added medication of Cymbalta for depression I have less focus, more agitation, profuse sweating( especially after walking outside no matter the temperature)."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-19,adderall xr,Female,"Adderall is used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. I have personal experience with the Adderall is absolutely great for me! This medication has completely changed my life. Adderall Control behavior problems, Improves concentration and ability to focus on your work and have many other benefits."
55-64,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-23,adderall xr, ,"I'm 62 now and just started using Adderall at age 60. I have tried Many drugs over the years. The only thing that would help me before Adderall was Cylert. But Cylert is no longer a choice. When I first took Adderall I couldn't believe it. How I felt, how I communicated, how my attention span increased along with my focus. I just wish this drug was available to me growing up, would have made my life much easier. I take 20 mills. most days. There are some days I will not take any. Other than a little restless at night, I have had no side affects. I take no other medication and feel good now while understanding things more clearly."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-14,adderall xr,Male,"Other meds have not helped, but everyone is different.  For me a more stimulant med was the solution.  Over time the dosage has become less effective though"
13-18,Other,2023-02-19,adderall xr,Female,"I take Adderall IR twice a day for PTSD-related dissociation and ADD dopeyness. It is the only thing that helps me with dissociation. Regular PTSD medicines only made it worse and I am very glad that this helps. 

My only complaint is that the XRs all contain blue food coloring, which I am allergic to. My doc would prescribe it to me in place of the two IRs if I wasn't. "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-05,adderall xr,Female,I was put on this medication for ADHD. This medication has been a life savor. I don't take it often bc I don't need it all the time but my husband has pointed out that I am a different person when I'm taking it. I started reading and i think it helped with some depression I didn't realize I had. But I also up and downs of being tired and awake. I do notice the effects wear off quick. So I just take it a little later in the day.
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-06,adderall xr,Female,"I personally love this drug. I take 50 mgs. When i went to rehab they made me stop taking it, and because i'm 17. but overall this is the greatest drug everr! :)"
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-19,adderall xr,Female,"It works for me, my mood is more regulated, I can pay attention and I don't interrupt as much. However, I think it's important to realize that this drug won't make you a super student - It allows me the capacity to develop the habits of a good student that ADHD had prevented me from creating. I do find the XR doesn't last as long as promised, (currently on 20mg) so I take 5mg IR mid morning and 5mg in the afternoon. I rated it a lower usability scale, because getting a refill is a hassel. I have to pick up a physical paper prescription from my doctor's office to give to the pharmecy, then the pharmacy has to fill it and it takes longer because it is a controlled substance. It's a 2-3 hour ordeal sometimes. "
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-28,adderall xr, ,"There is a honemoon phase with these. First effective. But once your body adjusts, there is an up and down feeling through the day. Tired, awake, tired,awake. The second issue is that they dont last as long as it supposed to. If you have an early start to your work week, dont bother taking them until late morning. Even after diet changes,exercise,supplements, and restful night sleep, It is still a luck of the draw how effect the XR will work that day. "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-25,adderall xr, ,"I went from having a terrible time in college focusing and remembering anything. I was getting strait Cs across the board, but now with the medication I'm getting all As wish I started sooner."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-21,adderall xr,Female,"Helps very well although the 30mg XR doesn't last long, I'm also on a regular one for late afternoon early evening due to the XR wearing off. "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-09,adderall xr,Male,We'll I used to take 2 30 xrs a day now I take one as I'm prescribed just docs can get a little expensive. The first person to diagnose me with it was the head of psychiatry at a hospital next me he also diagnosed me with depression and anxiety I believe it all goes together though
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-16,adderall xr,Male,"In school this drug did make me tired, i was always hungry and i did have a different ""mentality"". My freinds were constantly telling me that i have changed and that i was more annoying than usual."
55-64,Other,2023-06-03,adderall xr,Female,I was diagnosed with Adult Attention Deficient Disorder unfortunately not until I was in my early 30's. I have tried several different medications and have found that the Adderall XR works best for me. I take 30mg BID.  
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-05,adderall xr,Female,"Initially, I started with a low dose of Adderall, then I have slowly progressed to 25 mg.  I don't find that the 25 mg is ""enough"" because I am still having trouble focusing, getting organized, etc.  I see that the ""maximum"" dose is 30 mg of the XR.  I am scared that if I go to the 30 mg, and it isn't enough, where do I go from there?  I need to have a conversation with my doctor to troubleshoot this.  I would recommend the Adderall if you need it, but be mindful of the ""mood swings.""  I do find it to help significantly with anger, and I am not sleepy during the day. "
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-03,adderall xr,Female,I think I was miss diagnosed as having ADHD and taking Adderall XR 30mg plus 20mg at 4:00pm is making me nuts! I've told my doctor. Plus has me on Wellbutrin XR 300g and Lamical 300mg. I do not know what to do ... I am on a waiting list for new psychiatrist to do something for me. Something is not right and this quack is not listening. I asked to be taken off my meds and without question he asked which ones and that I could do two at once. I don't know how I am still alive. Seriously. 
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-31,adderall xr,Male,I have been taking Adderall XR for roughly 7 years now in varying doses from 30mg to 10mg to 20mg now. My Father is a phycologist specializing in children with learning disabilities so as a child i tried several different drug (names of which i do not remember) that failed to work for me or caused too many side effects. i had been taking a 30mg dose daily for about 5 years before i decided i wanted to wain off of it so no im on a lower dose. Although i have read that there are a rather large number of side effects i have only experienced a lack in hunger and occasion difficulty to sleep (only on days when ive been late taking it). overall this drug has helped me significantly in school and general day to day life although i am concerned about the lack of knowledge in the long term use of this drug.
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-22,adderall xr,Female,"If you have Depression, this will 100% up your depression. It works so well for my focus but i lost over 70 pounds on it, and it did make my Depression worse. It has it side effects. "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-29,adderall xr,Female,"Update: On 20mgXR for 2 months now, was on 10mg.  The 20mg seemed to help but for the past couple of weeks Iv noticed I zone out again and miss information during a conversation.  Im thinking I need to have my dose increased but afraid to ask my doctor.  Wish I knew what the average dose is that people take. 20mg seems low to me."
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-03,adderall xr,Female,I started this medication after i was diagnosed with ADD at the age of 14. overall i am extremly pleased with how well it works! i can sit down and really focus for an extended period time for what feels like the first time in my life. the only side effect Im displeased with is that it makes me completely lose my appetite. ive tried other medications to make sure that the other ones don't work better but i always come back to adderall XR
45-54,Other,2023-02-03,adderall xr,Male,"My doctor prescribed Adderall XR in 2006 after I'd lost both parents to cancer and was depressed. Today, it consistently helps me focus at work and be as productive as I can be with a positive attitude. I don't take it daily, only when I know I need to perform at a higher level. I truly do not feel addicted to it. I take it because I want to, not because I need to. No side effects. Shortly after taking, I feel like I'm able to accomplish whatever I set out to do. In high school my baseball coach told us that you should want the batter to hit the ball your way, because you are confident you'll make the play - every time. That's how Adderall XR makes me feel."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-29,adderall xr,Female,"I have a hard time staying focused during a conversation & completing a task and this medication has helped alot. I still have issues but it has got better.  Im on a small dose of 10mg Adderall XR daily.  I don't have any problems with the Adderall making me hyper or keeping me up at night.  If anything, by the end of the day I am so tired and asleep by 9:30.  Doesn't really kill my appitite either.  Too bad, thats always a nice SE to have.  :)  Will be sure to add another review once I have been on it longer."
55-64,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,2023-03-23,adderall xr,Female,I have been taking 60mg of Adderal XR every morning and an additional 30mg at 2pm every afternoon for the past 5 years. Even with our crappy insurance it was pretty expensive but I litteraly could not get out of bed with it. We got a letter in November that because of Obamacare they will no  longer  be paying for 10 of my 18 perscriptions (all of the expensive ones like Adderall) and will only cover 20% of generics only. Plus we have to use CVS which is super  evpensive! I really miss my adderall!!! 
55-64,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-04,adderall xr,Male,"I saw this and figured I would throw my two-cents in. There are naysayers who will question my post but, I am 55 yrs old and take two Adderall 25mg caps daily. No significant increase in BP ( it went up a bit only by 3 pts ) and no heart issues except I am a couch potato ! This is a "" wonder drug "" for me since being diagnosed by 2 psychologists and a doctor on 2002. The main reason for all the professional people was my doctor making sure I was not faking Adult ADHD just to get "" speed "" for no good reason. My doctor told me there is almost a steady stream of junkies trying to hustle him for dope ( meds that are not needed ). I had to work close with my doctor to get the right dose. Look at it like a lone window on one side a garage. You want to get "" inside "" the window, not before it or after it. ADHD meds no good if either or. That may explain why many parents "" freak out "" when their kid gets actually worse. Adderall may not be right for all persons. With my 49 yr old brother, Ritalin works best. Hope this helps."
65-74,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-14,adderall xr,Female,I finally can get my chores done daily and most importanly focus and depression decreased.
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-27,adderall xr,Female,I have been taking Adderall xr 20mg for 5 years now. I stumbled upon my attention or inability to focus issues when I became aware of my sons. I realized I dealt with these issues myself. I was prescribed this medication and within a month I was back in school and focused. It really changed my life. There is always cons to taking any medication and this one is no exception. Missing a dose is like missing an accomplished day. However I am pleased with the overall results this medication has provided for me in my life.  
35-44,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,2023-01-25,adderall xr,Female,"I started at 20mg of adderral ER, and from the very beginning I knew this wasn't  going to  be enough because I have such a high tolerance  for medication. I knew this one little extended release pill wouldn't do what I needed it to do.  Like helping  me stay alert and be more focused. Be better able to concentrate, and focus on tasks at hand much easier, but I gave it a shot. Did gain a bit more energy to get things done, but still very exhausted and no motivation past two p.m.in the afternoon. So, around two pm I took another twenty milligrams And I felt far more focused, happy, outgoing and much more productive. All the anxiety ceased! For me, I think that I metabolize drugs so fast that whether it be an Extended or an immediate release, they both really just affect me the same. I don't feel any difference, except the ER make me a little irritated, so maybe just the immediate release is better, two or three times a day at 20mg or maybe 30mg, each dose.  Either way, the adderral helps tremendously! Couldn't live without it!"
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-27,adderall xr,Female,Im happier. An think to much into things. My marraige is better.
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-01,adderall xr,Male,my Grandson is fourteen and takes 20 mg of adderall xr.Ithink it is not the right does.should i talk with his doctor?
25-34,Other,2023-02-27,adderall xr,Female,"I am 34 years old and have ADD. I have been taking Adderall XR 30mg twice a day (60mg) since 2010. Adderall makes me focus and concentrate on tasks that I felt lazy about before. Prior to taking this medication, I was unable to concentrate, felt very unmotivated, sluggish, and was doing poor at work which inevitably made me lose my job. Since taking Adderall XR, I am completing tasks on time, 100% motivated, I have more energy, and I'm able to focus. I have also been more punctual and nothing gets left undone. However, the side effects: This medication is very addictive. If you have an addictive personality, do not take it. You will be dependent on it and won't be able to function without it. Sometimes when the medication wears off I get moody and irritable. It's also good to take this medication very early as it will keep you up at night. I have to take other medications to help me sleep, otherwise I would be up for days, which has happened. (When I don't take my sleep meds.) This medication also decreases my appetite completely. I don't ever feel like eating anything until the medication wears off, and then I want to eat everything in site. I've also noticed that if you eat big meals while on Adderall, it takes away the effects of it. Also, I have tried other ADD medications, such as: Ritalin, Vyvanse, and Strattera and none of them work as well for me as Adderall.   "
55-64,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-12,adderall xr,Female,"it has helped me concentrate & focus as well as keeping me calm
"
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-15,adderall xr,Male,I have a son on this medication and need to know how long after he quits taking it will it be in his system?
25-34,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,2023-06-01,adderall xr,Female,"i just found out i was 2 weeks pregnant, how safe is this drug, or should i not take it at all"
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-11,adderall xr,Female,"My daughter is 10 yrs old. She has been on it for 4 days and has severe headaches, diarrhea and is nauseated the duration of the day. I have seen her temperamental mood swings in the last 4 days get worse! "
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-27,adderall xr,Male,this has helped in being able to deal with his severe adhd defiant disorder.
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-14,adderall xr,Female,"My son is 7 and has been taking this for about 6 months. the first month was rough because he was getting used to the drug. the next few weren't too bad, he was on 10 mg. we upped it to 15 because it wasn't lasting as well as we liked, and now he is having trouble sleeping."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-30,adderall xr,Female,"Ive taken Adderall since I was 9. For me it made it much easier to pay attention and complete tasks.. it makes everything seem so ""interesting."" I made much better grades in school. I was organized and well behaved. AS far as ADHD symptom, it pretty much eliminated them. However, Adderall has some side effects. I experienced rapid heart rate, higher blood pressure, extreme ""states of concentration"" (to the point where I could sit and do 500 math problems without stopping, without even wanting too), weight loss, and extreme mood swings. It made it impossible for me to sleep. It changes your personality and makes you extremely quiet. IT is VERY VERY addictive. If you miss a day, its hell.. I would be very tired, moody, and eat a lot. Its almost impossible to stop taking. Your brain learns to rely on it to function. Overall, for me, Adderall is effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD, however, you need to be aware of the side before you start taking it. Also as a child who was raised on the drug (my parents thought they were helping) I would never in a million years put my own children on Adderall. \"
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-16,adderall xr,Female,"All though this medication did work effectively, I started developing ticks and I started hallucinating from it because it lowered my blood pressure. I was 6 at the time, and I was ""picking apples"" off my living room couch when my mom walked in."
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-23,adderall xr,Female,"I haven been taking Adderall XR for almost 2 years now, and my life has never been better. I find I have healthier relationships, I am able to focus better in school, and I even am a better driver. I notice that I can't be behind the wheel safely unless I take my medication. The biggest thing with Adderall is to not play ""doctor"" and stop taking it and then start again. If you take it as prescribed, you should have no problems. "
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-27,adderall xr,Male,"This medication really helps me focus, except the side effects for me have been loss of appetite (however I still eat a lot, so i've lost no weight), dehydration, occasional sleep loss, and worst of all, constipation."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-18,adderall xr,Female,"Took for almost four months and started to develop tics in and around my eyes.  Switching to something different.  It seemed to help a lot the first three months, then due to the tics the dr didn't want to increase the dose, so we're switching.  Cons - very bad breath and taste in my mouth, tics.  Pros - helped with focus, clear thoughts and as an aside, helped me lose some much needed weight."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-27,adderall xr,Female,"For me personally, this medication was not a good experience. I always sweating, lost my appetite, lost 30 lbs in almost a month, dry mouth, headaches, insomnia, palpatations, agitation, and anxiety which lead to panic attacks. Don't get me wrong it did get me to focus but all these side affects just weren't for me."

Problems focusing on tasks or starting 15 different things and never getting any of them completed. Saying ""stupid things"" or having angry outbursts and finding it very difficult to settle down after the outburst.

45-54,Other,2023-03-19,adderall xr,Female,I have adult onset ADD and have been on this medication before. My insurance stopped paying for it but now it is paying again since there is a Generic form of the ADDERALL XR CAPSULES.  I am hoping that it works as good as the non generic I was taking before.  I really got on track before when I was taking this medication. I have a hard time focusing on a task and finishing what I start. I may have several things started at one time in a day and nothing ever seems to get finished...When I was on the ADDERALL XR I was able to concentrate and finish projects. I hope to get back on track now that I have been able to go back on the ADDERALL XR CAPSULES.  And for anyone who has had to come off of it due to the cost there is a generic version out there now.  Good Luck everyone!!

7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-20,adderall xr,Female,"My 9yr old son has been on Adderall for almost 4 years now.  He has ADHD and Ausperger's. WITH IT he can focus in school, his behavior is more age-appropriate, he is more successful in completing tasks, and in general is much more in control of his own actions.  WITHOUT IT the change is remarkable - he is hyper, impulsive, and spirals out of control. He knows how he wants to be, but gets frustrated as he is unable to help himself. I would reccommend this medication to anyone who's child  has ADHD, as I see no reason for the patient to struggle with the disorder and feelings of failure, shame, low self-esteem, etc. that go with it.  It's an appropriate treatment for ligitimate medical condition!  We monitor his dose very carefully, and don't give it after 10:30AM, so he has no trouble sleeping at night. Others have mentioned addiction issues. That won't happen unless one abuses their meds and starts down that slope.  I suggest that if it weren't Adderall they abused, it would be another substance, so please DON'T BLAME THE MEDICINE - blame the addictive behavior.(and I mean no disrespect, I truly empathize with those people and what they endured)"

Within the past year my wonderful physician and I have been trying many different adhd medications and finally found that Adderall XR works for me. It is an amazing medication making it possible for me to function normally finishing tasks which is huge for me because I have 3 small children with many many school and extracurricular activities. I no longer feel like I'm losing my mind thinking I was going crazy forgetting things starting many tasks at once and never finishing them not sleeping due to my mind never ""turning off""! I now know what it's like to be productive and have the ability to actually fall asleep without taking sleep aides! Strongly encourage this medication to anyone with this horrible disorder!  :o ) "

I checked with my therapist just tonight, to see if he was hearing from other patients about picking at nails and skin on fingers, or about rashes on my arms, skin separation and bleeding under my skin. He has been hearing more lately about the picking of nails and skin on fingers.  If my skin issues end up being a bad side effect to adderall XR I'm going to be so angry at the medical profession for negligence because all of them have seen my skin.  I've even been sent by one, to an oncologist for cancer screening!  No doubt stimulant meds work for me and I'm grateful to have had access to them these past 12 years but doctors can no longer afford the time to learn/know what they should, in order to catch my ""severe allergic reactions""!   I may very well be switching to Concerta!"
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-01,adderall xr,Female,My 10yr old was just recentely diagnosed with ADHD. She was prescribed Aderall 10mg. She had only been taken it for 12 days before taken her off the it. We did not see any improvements and noticed she would get more emotional during the day and have some verbal outburts at times. We are trying our best as parents to help our chid. We along with her doctor recommended she stop taking aderall because of the side effects we were seeing and are now starting her on focalin xr 10mg. I would appreciate any comments as we wonder how long we should give the medicine to work before switching it to another one.
25-34,Other,2023-03-07,adderall xr,Male,"I have idiopathic hypersomnia. My sleep patterns prior to this medication were severe coma like conditions, it was un-telling when the next time I could ever wake up on my own. After a sleep study followed by a nap study to rule out narcolepsy, my pulmonologist deemed it not narcolepsy and started me on Provigil to see if conditions improved. Soon my need exceeded the maximum dose and he switched me to Adderall XR. I now take 60mg a day before bed. Yes, before bed. Taking the pills the morning didn't really work when I couldn't wake up to take them. I sleep wonderfully and after a couple years of taking this have finally established a routine sleeping schedule. I go to sleep every night at around 10-11pm and wake up at 6am every morning WITHOUT an alarm clock.

Since taking this pill, I've benefited nicely by some of it's other side effects mostly relating to learning capacity. I've never been one for reading, mostly because I'd fall asleep, but now, I'll read through an interesting text book like it was a novel.

A side effect I wish I had was decreased appetite and weight loss. Since this pill, I have gained 40-50lbs. Probably because I spend most of my spare time advancing in non-physical activities. If only a mental workout burned more calories.

Some really bad side effects include withdrawals. DO NOT stop taking this pill before speaking to MD. Imagine how bad you were before and double it; if you didn't have depression before, you will. Because this Med is a Class 2 in the US, it is highly controlled, very hard to refill and not run out. Talk to your MD about a backup MD when that one is out. There are no refills, you must have original signature (no faxing), maximum is 30 days per RX, and they can only release the RX one week prior to running out. Keep in mind any insurance authorizations as well."

It worked really well, my grades were outstanding then the grade I had in the past & my conduct was super. But now I started to rely on it too much, I started thinking that the adderall was the only reason I've past highschool & that it wasn't me. I think that the adderall does all the work for me, I lost total confidence on myself if I dont have adderall to read or study or go to school. I feel dumb if I read, study, or go to school without adderall, this has affected me alot. My psychologist told me I'll would grow out of it & that I put the effort in my school work not the adderall. Well the thought of the adderall doing everything for me is still in my head, it grew powerful to think it's really true. Hopefully soon I will overcome that thought but now I just rely on adderall to basically do anything educational "

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-11,adderall xr,Female,"When I first started taking Adderall XR (10mg) it was like I got my life back. I was just recently diagnosed with severe ADHD, moderate depression, and mild anxiety. I have known that something wasn't right with me since I was very little but I have parents who were in denial and too afraid of stigmas and what other ppl think about them to have had any help until now. With Adderall so far I have noticed that altho it definitely helps my concentration/focus/motivation it causes me to hyperfocus (act OCD) about certain things, my anxiety is worse, and I get mean and brutally/cruelly honest with those around me at times. I've also noticed that I talk to myself more often (which I've always done to a certain extent; like when I'm frustrated, doing math, or figuring something out)but now is more noticeable. I also have very bad dry mouth, an unquenchable thirst, and chapped lips. I can't go anywhere without a bottle of water and chapstick now. Otherwise, the sleep problems and loss of appetite went away after the first 3 days. Right now I'm in the 'deciding' phase trying to figure out if the benefits outweigh the side effects. I know that I have to continue some sort of medication along with my cognitive behavioural therapy because I can't function at normal expectations at this point otherwise but I'm uncomfortable with some of the possible side effects and the idea of becoming dependant. I have a history of street drug use(I self-medicated as a teen/young adult) and altho I have been clean for years I am always very careful and afraid of becoming that person again. Up until recently, I had only heard positive things about Adderall but now I'm not so sure. I guess I will finish off this month, talk to my psych more about it, and then go from there..."

Especially, I have a 20 month old and sit at a desk working on a computer all day. So, for the last 2 months I am taking 30mg XR twice a day. It's working great. I was on unorganized, missing dead lines and just would daydream and go on the internet. Taking the Addreall really helped with that but I was still having a little anxiety, worries and a little tense. Not a lot but I still felt it. The Dr. gave me Cybalta 60mg once day or instead the Cybalta, try 1mg of xanax. The 2 combine has given me energy, focus and I am in a good mood with basically no worries went I get home and can enjoy my time with my son.

13-18,Other,2023-02-13,adderall xr,Female,"I was prescribed this medication to balance out extremes in anxiety, mood, and temperament, and I have to say, it did its job.  I was calmer than I had been in years, I was able to hang with friends without wanting to leave after 30 minutes...However, no matter how effective it was, I begged my doctor to switch to a different medication because of the side effects.  

While taking this medication for five months, I lost my appetite to the point of being unable to even look at food without feeling sick resulting in extreme weight loss.  In addition, the medication affected my ability to fall asleep at night.  One of the most severe side effects I experienced was a sudden, extreme slowing of heart rate and drop blood pressure.  I experienced this side effect 7 times while on this medication and it would last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half, and each time it happened I know ""I don't want to die"" crossed my mind many times.  

After all of that, one can probably imagine how hard it was waking up every morning and willingly taking the medication that was not only supposed to help me, but was clearly hurting me too. In the end, I guess taking this medication just comes down to facing the side effects.  If you want something that works, this is it, but remember that the side effects for this medication are nothing to forget."

I didn't notice any improvement for attention and had side effects such as increased depression and feelings of hopelessness, lack of sexual desire,and tiredness. The depression issues are what helped me to see that Adderall wasn't working for me. I am already taking 200mgs of Zoloft and was doing well on that, so at first I thought maybe I needed to  increase the Zoloft. After another day of falling asleep after taking the Adderall and having had a full nights sleep, I decided it had to be the Adderall. Stopped taking it for 3 days and felt more energetic and depression lifted. Will keep communicating with the Dr. until I get it straight--or me straight!! :)"

My doc decided to let me try the 10mg dosage, didn't do much for me probably because of my weight at the time (5'9"" 210lbs).. so he upped me to the 20mg dose. That dosage has been pretty effective for me for the past 3 1/2 months so far. I take it pretty regularly but skip it sometimes on the weekends. Overall I am pretty happy with what seems like a subtle but welcome increase in my ability to stay focused and the uplift in my energy level. I've started watching my calories and exercising more (and I have to imagine the Adderall helps) and so far have dropped 20lbs and am more consistent with the exercise than I have been in many years.

I began taking the 30mg pills but suggested being lowered to the 20mg pills because I had many of the symptoms listed. I lost a lot of weight, as well as my appitite, and became very irritable. I also developed annoying little habits like tapping my foot and clicking my tounge uncontrolably. But overall, this drug has done wonders for me. My first year of 8th grade I failed miserably. I was written up over thirty times that year as well. I could not concentrate no matter how hard I tried, and I got in trouble so much because I was so hyper and bored. I was prescribed Adderall XR the next year and I did a complete turn around. I made honor roll and maintained an A average throughout the whole year. My behavior also change. I had a better attitude and did'nt get in any trouble at all. I have just graduated high school, and thanks to Adderall, I continued to make great grades and control my behavior throughout my high school years as well. I was even accepted into a great university and given a scholarship. Adderall changed my life. I am convinced that I would not be where I am now without it.

I come from a family who cares for me tremendously so it has nothing to do with them..So, before I started taking this it was hard for me to even get out of bed in the morning & carryout my day. I was diagnosed with bulimia/nervosa & depression so I take a combination of Prozac & Adderall and it has changed my life 100% and for the better. I wake up with energy, take on the day, I dont binge eat nor vommit because with the adderall suppressing my apetite I do not get the urge to eat when im bored. However, it is easy to maintain a healthy diet and eating regularly. For the first time I am making A's in my classes, which NEVER happened in highschool & I enjoy life so much more. The thing I really had to get used to was harnessing my energy. I would start a ""project"" and not want to finish it until I was done but i would really need to do homework or something of greater importance. I had to train myself to prioritize and make schedules, something that comes so easily to others. But, once I re-trained my brain how to function to be successful it really helped me get through life. Like I said, I'm finally making good grades AND getting to class (and everywhere else) on time. I'm not sure if I reccommend adderall to kids under the age of 15 unless theyre morally responsible but I definitely recommend it to young-adults & so on."
35-44,Other,2023-04-11,adderall xr,Female,"Iam a 41 year old female and i have been on adderrall now for a month but my doctor put me on it because due to extrem low energy levels and fatigue. Now i am wondering why they put me on this because i dont suffer from ADHD. And it states not to use the drug for tiredness.
So should i continue or not? Has anybody else been perscript this drug for fatigue? And if so has it help or hurt?"

19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-02,adderall xr,Male,"Adderall XR is a very effective treatment for ADHD.  It helps concentration all day.  In my experience, it should not be taken after 11:00 am because it may cause insomnia.  This medicine also decreases appetite, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on the patient.  I am not overweight, so the appetite supression became a slight problem for a while, but the positive effects outweighed the negative effects by far.  Once I had been taking it for a while, I was able to eat normally again, but people who are under-weight should be monitored in order to make sure they are eating enough.  Another thing about this medication is that it is very addictive.  It has been effective for me for the past 4 years, but I am unable to function normally without it.  People who are prescribed Adderall XR should be aware that they may become dependent, and if they are to discontinue taking it, they should definitely taper their dosage down fairly slowly.  Overall, Adderall XR has been an incredible improvement for my concentration.  I believe, however, that it should not be administered to young children because of it's strong effects.  If it is needed for a child, they should take the lowest effective dose."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-16,adderall xr,Female,"I was diagnosed with ADHD in 3rd grade when I started taking ritalin. The medication gave me ""ticks"" and terribled anxiety. I was off med treatment for adhd by the time i was 14. I managed to get through highschool and 2 years of college despite the trouble and chaos i got myself into. about a year ago i started taking adderall for my ADHD again. the first 8 months were great. my racing thoughts became more organized and i was able to prioritize my tasks in order to complete them. If you look at other posts listed here the users of 1-6 mo will have more positive feedback than those of long term. its been about a year and im trying to get myself off of this. i have started to experience withdrawal symptoms in the morning and evening. theyre terrible. i could avoid these symptoms by upping my dose but ultimatly that would be masking rather than solving. which is what so many people do. the drug is seriously effective for adhd but i would warn on dose amounts to be sure your not masking harmful dependency signs or the outcome in the longrun will be way worse than any adhd symptoms you thought were bad."
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-25,adderall xr,Male,"My son is now 11 and has been taking Adderal XR for about 3 years now. In the begining we tried a different medcation that was not lasting long enough for him. So we tried Adderal and over night we saw a big differance in him. He was about to concentrate through the whole day. I noticed that he would get emotional in the afternoon.  The way we fixed this was to make sure he had a snack in the afternoon to re-boost the medication.  The medication is time released right? so the reason for mood swings in the afternoon is because lack of protein in the body.  Try this and you should see a differance.

I have even tried other presription medications and they were less effective so I went back to Adderall XR. This medication calms me down tremendously and I am much more productive and overall just more organized. I am forty five but never was treated for ADHD until I was half way through grad school. This drug might have done wonders for me if I had been treated as a teen.

13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-04,adderall xr,Female,"The medication did its job, but the side effects were to strong for me. I had bad mood swings. I was dizzy all of the time. I was so tired, but I could not sleep. Eating made me feel like I was going to throw up. I was keeping my room clean and doing everything I was supposed to do because of the medication. I was more focused and serious about things, but I lost friends. I was no longer myself anymore. It took everything people loved about me away. I recomend to think before you use this drug and to be careful if you have important things coming up. The side effects totally changed who I was and what I could do. The friends I told about this were the ones that helped me when they started to notice things and that helped. When I finally stopped it took awhile for me to fully lose the side effects. Keep up with your side effects and make sure you think is it better for me to stop or keep going. In my case the bad totally wiped out the good. "
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-21,adderall xr,Female,"I have gotten most of the side effects on and off. So far the drug has caused more harm to me than helpfullness. My side effects have been on and off, and they normally are not all the same at once. They are constantly changing. The drug did help with my being able to focus but with the side effects I have gotten, I will most likely have to stop taking the drug."

55-64,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-03,adderall xr,Male,"I have been taking Adderall since last November (08). I was started on 20mg of Adderall xr, then went to 25 mg xr, and now I take 25mg xr in the morning around 6am, and then an Adderall IR, 10mg, around noon to one p.m. I think Adderall works great, the problem I had was that even though it is an XR formulation it seemed to wear off around noonish everyday. I was never able to get ""all day coverage"". In February my doctor added the 10mg IR ""booster"" and it has worked great ever since. He told me that every one's body metabolism is different and some get longer coverage than others. This is what worked for me. I was worried about sleep issues being on this dose, the amazing thing is I actually feel like I sleep better since being on this medication. When I lay down to go to sleep I don't have a million and one things floating through my head like I use to. It's like the background ""white noise"" is gone. My thoughts are so much clearer now and I can actually get things accomplished instead of 20 things half accomplished. It's too bad people abuse this drug, it's makes it more difficult for people who use it for legitimate medical purposes to get it. All of my other medications I can get a 90 day supply in the mail. With Adderall I have to go to my doctors office every month and pick up my prescription in person. Other than that absolutely no complaints. Good luck to all."

A lot of it was from taking Seroquel, so I stopped that and started Adderal.  What a difference.  More energy, focused, getting tasks done, I never felt better.  However after a brief month on Vyvanse,I went back to the Adderal and have had more side effects than before.I have been back on it for about 2 weeks. It works fine all day about 8-9 hours, however when it is begining to wear off I get really tired, irritable, very emotional, and a massive headache. I also take Wellbutrin XL 150mg and wondering if these two med's are to stimulating together.  I go back to the Dr. in 2 weeks."

Then my doctor decided to try Vyvanse 60 mg. Although the Vyvanse might have a few more undesirable side effects, such as shortness of breath and minor chest pain, during extreme physical activity, I'm pretty sure I like the Vyvanse better than Adderall. Still too early to tell for sure. "

Just a totally different child. I thought Omg, why did I waite so long to take him in to be treated!! Then, gradually it got horrible! He started having what I called ""These Fit's"" He would get so upset at the drop of a dime.On the way to the psychologist one day, we were leavin well he wanted a cheese sandwich and we were out of bread.The only bread was end pieces. Well he went CRAZY! Kicking, screaming, hollaring, ""I hate you! I wish you were dead! Nobody likes me anymore!"" It was as if the exordist had entered my little angles body. We got to psych. and it was only once I told him, that he was able to settle him down(after a 2 hour drive there)and he also got him a cheese sandwich. I later found out from his pediatrician that this was a really bad side effect of the meds.Except for the mood swings, outburst the medicine was great. But we had to switch to Concerta 18mg. cause the mood swings got worst and worst. Now, he is my little angle again. That just goes to show you, it is trial and error. Some meds work better for some people than other's. Hang in there, cause somewhere down the line, one will work the best!!!

Began only having cereal at breakfast and very little dinner Lost almost 20 pounds in 6 months. Was put on this 6 months ago, started at 10mg and worked up to 30mg. I'm actually a little unsure why I was put on it in the first place, though I do have trouble with my thoughts never to the extent of having difficulty in class.

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-03,adderall xr,Male,"Ok to start off I have known for sometime that I have had ADHD but when i was younger I didn't think much of it, and my parent wasn't all for drugging up the kids, Now right now my doctor has put me on the 15mg XR capsule, and to tell ya the truth, I haven't experienced too many side effects, i mean I have had the loss of apatite and insomnia sometimes but the insomnia is because i take it around 11am and I am a night owl to begin with. As for the loss of apatite I just decided to get more carbs protein all the calories etc, more in just a 1-2 meal's a day instead of having 3-4 ( yes i love to eat and I am a cook) But for the most part the loss of apatite will dissapate once i get myself, used to the medicine.

Now as for how it helps me out has been great, I have alot more focus, I don't feel that my mind is running around at 1000mps in 800 different directions. I also get that euphoric feeling of happiness, and sometimes catch myself spacing out to the clouds sometimes, or just good enjoyable moments that i prolly couldn't stop myself to see.

Overall I enjoy this medication, sometimes yes i get mad that i only get 4-6 hours of sleep but I am learning to manage my sleeping times to were it cycles just right, and now that i have been on it for about 10 days i am starting to actually sleep 1-2 hours more a night as long as knowbody calls me or etc. (before i was a heavy sleeper now I can't even take naps :( i will miss you naps.) but now i dont have to string my alarm clock across the room to force me out of bed and to turn it off etc cause before i would just sleep through it"

I could always get myself into trouble because I couldn't focus in class or I just got borred. I was always tired. After I started taking Adderall I started noticing a difference right away; I was a whole new person. I have been on 50mg a day for about 4-5 years now and I don't know what I would do without it. I can focus, finish everything I start, I have more energy. In the first year of taking Adderall I did loose a significant amount of weight, but for me...my appitite came back. I gained all that weight back and have no problems eating meals on a regular schedule. Not to worry. "
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-28,adderall xr,Female,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but my parents chose nonpharmalogical methods to deal with it then.

After passing my nursing boards and having a job that required responsibilty, so to speak, I talked to my docotr and she was amazed that I had made it this far in life with the severity of my symptoms.  I have been on Adderall 30mgBID (twice a day) and can not believe the difference.  I am a full time student and work full time nights also, I have total ability to complete everything as needed. I no longer procrastinate on anything and feel so much more organized.  I have had about 20 lbs weightloss so I am 5'2"" and 107 which doesn't look so healthy. another side affect that I experince is the ability to sleep forever when I don't take it.  I have no problems sleeping at night on the days I take it but its nothing for my husband to come and wake me up and it be 2pm :(! I have also found that having gum on hand at all times helps with the dry mouth.  I have a question for anyone taking adderall XR... do you pay attention to foods with citric or asorbic acid because these have been said to decrease the effect and speed up the breakdown of adderall????

Adderall XR has worked well to fill a void that was missing in my quest for balance.  It provides a ""kick"", of sorts, to the mind and body.  I find it spurs mental motivation, which in turn, the body responds to quite well.  I take 1 in the a.m and 1 in the mid afternoon.  This seems to get me through to the early evening. Note:  There is some irrability experienced, in my case, as the dosage fades.  Foretunately,I discovered Strattera long before adding Adderall XL, which actually works very well as a counter measure.(Read my review on Strattera).  Although, I should add that Adderall XL does not have the crash that I experienced on some of the more popular ""stimulated"" drugs.  Nor do I feel a ""pull"" of dependency.
That being said, I did inadvertently take a short ""Holiday"" from the drug, and noted  a definite drop in mood towards depression accompanied by an increased lethargic feeling. A withdrawl effect. Not dire, but to be noted, nonetheless.

I have been on Adderrall ever since and it seriously is a God send.  In high school I just got by, and that was with a struggle.  After that I completed a two year degree with a 3.76, and went on to get a four year degree and held a 3.9.  Now I am going on for my masters and I am confident with myself that I will excell.

He became depressed and his grades dropped. The symptoms improved when I took him off the medicine for a few days and returned when started taking them again.  He had become depressed again because he could not focus in class. He is now taking Adderall 10mg instead of the Adderall XR.

Increased my ability to focus on important details, caused a 25lbs weight loss in 6 weeks..I looked anorexic because I'm tall and slender as it is.  If I drink coffee during the day I'm like a crackhead - very antisocial, nervous, won't answer the door phone etc, lose track of time, and crazy OCD.  So I cut down on the coffee and that's working.  I also take ""drug holidays""  just to make sure I don't ""need it"".  When I want energy and need to focus I take it..otherwise, I leave it. I also experience mood swings and my muscles tighten up, so I get buns of steele without the exercise.  I have the best career in the world and taking adderall makes me even better at it.  Be smart, take it properly and pay attention to the side effects and you'll be alright.  I worry about children taking it because they need to be social and be accepted by their peers, and it's tough if you lack personality.  So three years for me and I'm in control of it and happy.  Oh..and when I take the drug holiday, I don't get withdrawals..just more tired than usual for the first several days.  Take Vitamin B for that."

I barley made it through college due to my lack of attention and followthrough. I tried Strattera and I was a walking zombie. I hated it. Then my Dr. put me on Adderall xr and it has been fabulous. I only take 20mg a day and should talk to my Dr. about bumping up my  dose, however, I am very consiencious due to the fact that I am a recovering alcoholic for 14 years. Adderall xr has changed my life. I used to dread going to work and very busy days and now I know I can get through it. I respect Adderall and never take more than the Dr. prescribes (trust me I have been tempted to). I do have problems sleeping at times so often if I have an early morning I don't take my second dose later in the afternoon the day before. This drug has saved me so much anxiety before I was on it and how I was going to get through the day. I do get irritable and cranky at times but the payoff of focus and energy out weigh the unfocused, lethargic piece of crap I was before this. Bad News. I have not lost any weight.

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-18,adderall xr,Female,My five year old son has been on this med now for abotu three months. We started at 10 and worked up to 25. he is irratable in the afternoons to the point if you say boo he breaks down crying. We have taken him off the meds as of lst saturday. He is intolerable
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-27,adderall xr,Female,"I have been taking 25mg of Adderall XR for almost 3 months now. I have to say I've had a pleasent experience with this. I am in Nursing school, so the Adderall gives me that extra push I need. I feel like I constantly need to be studying, I listen & take better notes in class, and my grades have got better. I am also able to study for longer periods of time because I have more energy & can stay up later. However, I have had some pretty drastic side effects. I occasionally have dry mouth, but my anxiety & stress seems to be 10000 times worse, I seem to make situations alot worse than they actually are. I am ALOT more irratible & don't have much patience. It has made me very blunt, so I hope noone makes me mad. & my finger has got to where it twitches but other than that.... & on the days I don't take it, i'm so tired, I can hardly keep my eyes open but i'm in a happier mood, just too tired to do anything. So for the most part, my exp. with Adderall has been good. ALOTTT better than Methyphenidate (wayyyy ti many SE!) which I was taking prior to the Adderall XR. "
19-24,Other,2023-03-29,adderall xr,Male,"I play college baseball at the Division 1 level which requires attending class on days we're not on the road, studying when traveling, working out constantly, getting home from road games at 3 a.m. and having class at 8:30 a.m. that next day. I was diagnosed with ADD a year ago and ever since then being a student-athlete and keeping up with school as well as performance on the field because of Adderall has made a world of difference. It creates absolute attention on one subject at a time and a great sense of focus. Taking more than recomended though can cause shortness of breath and heart issues. "
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-15,adderall xr,Male,"Its great, im focused, productive and serious. my friends always know i when i take because i dont joke around as much as ido when i dont take it.  when it all comes down to it, its a great way to keep moving forward instead of not knowing what move to make next."
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-27,adderall xr,Female,I actually love how I can stay awake and concentate so much better but the bad thing is my tongue...I can not stand how dry it makes my mouth and even though I drink water all day long my tongue seems to get effected by it. It always has a a spot that kills...
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-22,adderall xr,Female,My peditrician has given my daughter this med for over a year and we had to go up to 20 mgs from 15mgs.  
 ,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-08,adderall xr, ,I am a mother of a 9 yr old boy with ADHD and my son has been taking Adderall xr 30mg for about 3yrs now and my husband and I found that the medications seems to help him consentrate but his mood is unbearable sometimes. He just comes home from school and doesn't want to speak to anyone. It is very frustrating and I always think how nice it would be to have my little boy. The doctor takes him off of it during summer break and sometimes that is hard to deal with but well worth it. Does anyone have any suggestions?
19-24,Other,2023-02-12,adderall xr,Female,"I am now really able to concentrate, whereas before that was never an option for me. I am finally able to focus and better myself, as now I am much more productive with my days."
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-01,adderall xr,Male,"well, i have ADHD and adderall has been the best thing for me. I concentrate a WHOLE lot better, raise my hand more in school, and feel better. But its not as good as it seems. Well for me, it causes me to talk really fast, have a lot of energy and clean. I get like freaking ocd and everything has to be clean. And i know this sounds weird but if there is no one around to talk to, i noticed that i will talk to myself. I cant sleep at all on days i dont wake up at 5. I have dry mouth but i always got a Arizona ice tea with me. One major thing i get that i absolutely hate is that i either get over excited over things, or if im scared its like 100000 times worse and im sure its not me cause when i dont take it im like never scared.

25-34,Other,2023-02-20,adderall xr,Female,"I have to switch up my use of adderall. I'm prescribed 2 30 mg tablets a day, however, I noticed that if I take 2 a day every day I get very agitated, irritated and frusterated. Sometimes I take 1, sometimes 2, and sometimes none at all. My doctor said this is OK. I also noticed that I have to take a xanax to ""come down"" from adderall, as it gives me a lot of energy. It does help me focus better and it gives me more motivation. My work performance has improved and I sincerely believe this drug has saved my job. This is a drug you have to figure out the doses and how much your body can handle. I've been taking it for a total of 2 years."

35-44,Other,2023-03-15,adderall xr,Female,"Today is my first day taking Adderall. I'm taking 10mg XR. My doctor prescribed it because of my depression. Two years ago I had 7 major surgeries and spent a whole year in the hospital. Since then I haven't been myself. For the past several months I have not wanted to leave the house. All I want to do is stay in bed or lay on the couch and watch tv all day. I don't go to work unless I absolutely have to. I'm a Realtor so I work when I want to, which isn't much. My doctor and I are hoping this medicine will help me get my drive and motivation back. I seem to have lost a part of me. I also take Cymbalta 60mg, and Subutex 8mg. I just switched from Lexapro to the Cymbalta so I'm still waiting to see how the Cymbalta will work. I've only been on it a month. As far as the Adderall, I took it this morning and haven't really noticed anything different yet. Does it take a while to kick in or build up in your system? Maybe I don't have a high enough dose? I guess I'll just keep taking it and see what happens. I'll write again when I have more things to say about it."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-06,adderall xr,Female,"Was diagnosed at the age of 42 with ADD after many years of telling my doctors I could not concentrate or focus on anything.  I know this affected my relationships.  I wish my doctors caught it when I was in younger.  Teachers were very cruel and affected my selfesteem.  I've been on Adderal XR for a few months now and the changes have been amazing.  I have IBS and this drug has helped since the drug I was taking for my IBS is no longer on the market.  I have trouble sleeping but I have always has severe insomnia.  I've lost a lot of weight then again I had high blood pressure and needed to.  I feel a whole lot better with myself, more confidence now in anything that I do.  I've been promoted on my job several times in two years.  My ability to focus and retain info has been amazing.  "

I was on Vyvanese for a little bit, but I really didn't like the side effects and felt it didn't do very much. I'm currently a sophomore in college and Take 30mg of adderallXR once a day. It really has been a godsend. My brain is not scrambled and I can actually organize and accomplish tasks at the correct due date! Something I could never do before, no matter how hard i tried. Yes i've lost around 20 pounds since starting Adderall my Senior year of high school (i've been on it around 2 years now) but I'm still at a healthy weight and I'm so much happier with who I am now. I know adderall is desired by many college students and therefor gives it a bad reputation, but Adderall really is a great drug for those of us that ACTUALLY have the disorder!"

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-09,adderall xr,Female,I had taken Aderall XR 20 mg and found that I had very severe adverse reactions to the drug which continued even when I lowered my dosage. I either have a sensitive system or an allergic to the medicine; however I just think everyone should be extremely cautious as it will not work with every system. Have you read the possible side effects they are very serious. 
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-07,adderall xr,Male,"I have been prescribed Adderall XR 10mg that I take once in the morning.  The medication works very well, but takes some getting used to.  It does cause me to be more OCD but it is a fair trade off for the positive benefits."
 ,Other,2023-01-30,adderall xr,Female,"Being diagnosed with MS many years ago, along with MS comes a lot of fatigue!! My neurologist prescribed Adderall 30mg xr about 3 years ago and has been my lifesaver ever since. I continue to work a stressful full time job and am thankful for this that it gets me through my day. I have no problems sleeping whatsoever and am a power napper once I get home from work. It does not have the affect of not being able to sleep, but then again, other reviews I've read seem like it is highly prescribed for ADD disorders.  It has truly helped me with my disease and cannot imagine ever going off of it. As long as this drug is not abused, it does wonders! I take 1 30mg a day, and have on some days taken 2, but never more than that. "
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-08,adderall xr,Male,"I have tried a few different ADHD and this has worked the best for me by far. My ADHD is mostly impulsivity, but hyperactivity was also sometime problematic. Concentration was never really a problem for me. In school I often got in trouble for shouting out answers without being called on. Also before I started Adderall I almost always reacted before I thought, and said and did a lot things that I regretted later. Now I usually think out actions before I act, so I get in a less fights now. The only drawbacks to the medication are because it is extended release you HAVE to remember to take it early in the day or else you will be up like all night. Also  probably the only real side effect that bothers me is the apetite reduction. But I have found the best way to get around that is eat a good breakfast before you take it, and have some healthy snacks around the house for when the medicine wears off night so you can have something to eat. Overall I am very satisfied with Adderall xr and a pleasant surprise was if I woke up too late and didn't take it  I didn't experience any major negative consequences, but I did have to try a little bit harder to make sure I was thinking before I spoke. "
25-34,Other,2023-01-28,adderall xr,Male,"I take 20 mg tab in the morning then one at lunch time to funish out the day.  I suffer from PTSD, Maj Dep Disorder, Gen Anxiety disorder and a few other things.  THis med has me focused and close family and friends see that I am a better person as a result of taking this med.  20mg at 7 am then another 20 at noon or 1pm.  I fall asleep and stay asleep.  I do not take it on the weekends to keep as to not build a tolerance.  It has worked so far.  I have been on this dose for over 1 month now.  Highly recommended."
55-64,Other,2023-03-30,adderall xr,Male,"I have been on this medication for 3 years now and it has changed my life. I like many others here hated myself because I felt lazy I struggled in school to make average grades. In my short college stint one of my professors pulled me aside told me he had pulled my file and wondered why I did so badly in his course because my test scores were so high. I have been successful but it was a long hard struggle. My wife of 32 years is a retired special education teacher. About four years ago she told me that she didn't know why it never dawned on her but she felt I was ADD. I am not hyper but have always had trouble staying focused. In school I use to fight the urge to look out the window and I couldn't concentrate. I went to my doctor and was tested he felt this medication would help me. Boy was he right! I makes me wonder where I might be if this could have been diagnosed when I was a child and there would have been treatment for it. At that time I was considered lazy and treatment was staying in at recess and having to write ""lines"". I still struggle with time management and the urge to be sidetracked but I am improving on both accounts."
25-34,Other,2023-01-25,adderall xr,Female,I have been taking Adderall XR 20mg for almost three months and I can't even begin to describe the effect it has made on my everyday life. I wake up in the morning looking forward to the day and don't worry about all the possible scenarios where my social anxiety could kick in and cause a anxiety/panic attack. It has really helped me be able to become a part of the world again. I can concentrate at work and all of my relationships have greatly improved. I have lived with treatment resistant depression and anxiety for almost 10 years now and I wish that I had found Adderall XR so much sooner!
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-01,adderall xr,Female,"I have been on Adderall XR since it first came out.  I have been taking meds for ADHD for 28 yrs now.  I like Adderall XR because it lasted longer than the Ritalin, therefore I didn't have the up down up down feeling.  Adderall is a smoother transition too.  Of course it is not a cure all.  I still watch what I eat, work on time management, and do the occasional talk therapy.  I have also been the subject of multiple studies on ADHD since I was ""raised on Ritalin"" here it what I learned.  I am more prone to Alcoholism, I am more prone to ""falling in love"", I am more prone to acting out my anger.  Actions and feelings are easy impulses but my ADHD is not an excuse.  My mind understands, what has been so hard is to delay the impulse whether I am on medication or on a medication vacation.  I take 30mg of Adderall XR in the morning, 30 mg of ritalin in the afternoon, 80 mg of Straterra, and 300mg of Wellbutrin.  All this Medication in one day so I take med vacations in order to lower my tolerance.  Funny thing is I am only diagnosed with ADHD.  Believe me Doctors have tried to find some other condition bc ADHD usually is combined with ""something else"" but I am a classic ADHD case.  Getting meds for ADHD is easy now adays what is hard is taking responsibility for your treatment after your diagnosis.  I quit drinking, have taken the anger and time management classes, and married a man I respected.  I also don't use my ADHD as an excuse in my professional life, my employeers don't need to know my personal life.  Finally Yoga has had a great affect on my ability to focus, HUGE.  I hope the people who are ADHD make it clear to their Doctors that the H means hyperactive NOT manic.  I have experienced too many non ADHD doctors who are ready to label and prescribe the newest ""condition"".  I don't have much respect for the medical communities understanding of ADHD.  All I know is that the medication is only one part of the equation, its the easy part.  Good luck i hope i helped."

45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-30,adderall xr,Male,"I've probably lived my entire 49 yrs with undiagnosed ADD, but over years of building defense mechanisms to compensate, it evolves into issues that don't fit the traditionally accepted symptoms. I was never hyperactive, don't currently have difficulty reading or focusing on specific tasks. I do however, tend to hyperfocus, don't like interruption and don't transition very easily. I also don't like a lot of activity and noise as that affects my ability to focus. At times, my mind is being barraged with a bunch of external and internal stimuli. It becomes too much and I will get irritable and react negatively to my family. It's not the way I feel inside, but it's all right on the surface trying to defend my focus. It has evolved into a degree of anxiety and depression about the inability to soften the impact of stimuli. I was starting to get more and more down, more withdrawn, and dark. I tried some of the anxiety/depression medication like Zoloft (a year and a half), but I felt more anxiety from them. I am not sure the Zoloft ever worked for me at all. I finally decided one day to try my daughter's Adderal (she also has ADD). The difference was significant. 80% of the negative stimuli dissipated and was replaced with positive feelings... confidence, patience, peace. Everything became more manageable and I felt a lot more normal. So after a couple months on Adderal XR25, it is working pretty well... not perfect, but a lot better. I also tried Focalin and was initially prescribed Vyvanse. The Vyvanse laid too heavy on me and I felt out-of-body. The Focalin was better, but the Adderal XR25 seemed the best fit. For adults, symptoms and issues around ADHD don't fit the traditional. The psych said adult ADHD is in the process of being redefined by the medical community.  "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-08,adderall xr,Female,"I started this medication a few weeks ago. Before I started this I had no energy at all, I couldn't focus, had a lot of social anxiety, couldn't concentrate, It was hard to get me to do anything. I started on 10mg and so far I am doing great, I wish I started this medication years ago. I still feel like I have some of the symptoms which I am going to talk to the doctor about increasing it. It has raised my anxiety pretty bad, But its fix all of the other symptoms or fix my anxiety. I felt my ADHD was worse than the anxiety. Would recommend this medication to any adult that has ADHD problems. "
35-44,Other,2023-03-27,adderall xr,Female,"I used to be on Adderrall to treat my ADD and daytime sleepiness for 1 year and then stopped taking it because it didn't seem to have the same effect anymore - it platoed. No withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. I have been back on it now for about 4 months. It gives me great energy but not the way it used to. I am also taking Prozac to treat depression, and I think that the Prozac might buffer the Adderall a bit. I am a bit concerned about potential abuse but knowing that I can stop w/o terrible withdrawal makes me feel better about that. I used to take Adderall with Cymbalta, and Cymbalta seemed to support the effect of Adderall. I stopped taking Cymbalta (with horrible, horrible withdrawal) because it platoed as well. In general, I agree that Adderall is a great medication but it has to be taken responsibly."
35-44,Other,2023-05-29,adderall xr,Female,"I have been prescribed Adderall for extreme fatigue and daytime sleepiness. It has been a true life saver. Wen I am on it, I am the person I feel I am supposed to be. The only drawback is that my sytem seems to get used to it and I am concerned about potential abuse. Has anybody experience with long-term use, especially in conjuction with Prozac and/or Abilify? Thank you."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-30,adderall xr,Male,"I used to think I was a lazy person. I hated it. This drug has changed my life. I never thought I had anything wrong with me medically despite my crippling inattention and mild bipolar depression. Then a friend gave me an adderall, and I wanted to get a scrip for it because it was such an improvement over my regular life. But my doctor wanted me to get tested for ADD... I really didn't think I'd turn up positive, but I did, as well as the previously mentioned bipolar. So instead of giving me adderall IR right off the bat, he wanted me to try XR. It's been perfect. I never feel drugged at all, it feels totally natural, and it defeats my regular daily depressive feelings and gives me energy. I can now follow my dreams and passions with an un-stifled hope and confidence."
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-27,adderall xr,Male,"I hate the tast of it, bit it's doing me well. I don't know how long I've been taking it, but I feel like it's working. I feel drowsy in the morning, but when I take it at lunch, (this pill is only 10miligrams so I have to take it twice) I feel wode awake, kinda like having a 5 Hour Energy shot. Now if only I had a billion dollars, I would spend five million on reserch for ADD/ADHD. But that'll take a while because I started taking Adderal at some young age."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-05,adderall xr,Female,"I have been on adderall for a year now and it has really helped me out. I am so focused and awake, it has saved my full time job and has allowed me to work a second job and be successful at both. I can concentrate so much better! The only problem is that I've learned I can't take the second adderall after noon or I won't sleep at night. I also learned that I can't take 2 every day like the doctor prescribed. I have to either take 1 a day and skip the weekend, or 2 every other day or I will get agitated easily and the withdrawls from coming off of it for a couple of days is horrendous! It makes me feel like I have the flu or something. It is very addictive because of the effectiveness-concentration and being wide awake. Overall, I would recommend this drug to anyone with ADD, but would also recommend being closly monitored by your doctor, as this drug can be very addictive.  "

Then concerta 18mg, Wow this one scared me his heart felt like it was going to come out off his chest) Now adderall xr 10mg. He been on it for less then a month. He is still himself just without him been in all over the place. I'm worried most about these side effects. can be habit-forming,affect weight, growth rate. Like i said before he is 7 to think that he would have to be on this medication for a long time, then these side effect worried me.  "
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-23,adderall xr,Female,I have been taking this medication for 6 years now I have only upped it by 5 mg once. I still feel focus on some things unless something else in my life is really going wrong. I take 2 a day and yes I have lost the weight but that is no big deal for me. I like the focusing on things.  With ADHD is a real challenge with me with the severe migraines I get. I also have small vessel disease in my brain. So you can imagine the medicine really works.

7-12,Other,2023-03-01,adderall xr,Female,"My 9 yr old daughter started this med in January. Diagnosed with ADD. It had improved her concetration in school but we are now seeing side affects. Trouble sleeping, can't get up in the morning for school. Weight loss.  The most troubling is her behavior, last night after being punished for an outburst she wrote me a letter telling me she wished she was never born, life would be better without her. I am stopping this med. the depression is too scarry."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-11,adderall xr,Male,"Very good medication for keeping focused for patients with ADD or ADHD. I had adult ADHD so my mind would try to focus on multiple things at once and it would overload. For the first few months the medication was great.

The last year and half has gone from good times to a living hell. I upped my dose from 20 mg to 20 mg and 15 mg in the afternoon. That is when the living hell began.

It made me feel like the world around me didn't matter. The only two things I cared about were my grades and my girlfriend. Everything else was non existent in my mind. I started losing friends left and right, I became a lot less sociable, and my parents knew something was up. When my only other friends I had told me what they noticed, the medication made me not believe them and I then became very paranoid.

I thought everyone around me was an enemy looking to make my life miserable someway or another. My anxiety levels skyrocketed and I always had my head on a swivel. It was a terrible way to live life. I even started thinking my girlfriend was up to no good when she wasn't around me so I started becoming clingy to her.

Thank God I stopped taking this medication. I found self worth in myself again and I my ex friends became friends with me again. Everyone in my life noticed a great difference and that's when I realized I needed to stop taking this medication.

My advice, ""DON'T TAKE THIS MEDICATION UNLESS YOUR ADD/ADHD IS RUINING YOUR LIFE."" And if you have to use this medication, make sure you use it only on the days you need to concentrate. Your life can spin out of control if you take this medication for an extended amount of time in my experience."

19-24,Other,2023-04-28,adderall xr,Male,"I'm a 21 year old male college student and I have ADHD-PI, along with depression and social anxiety. I started with depression and anxiety meds when i was 16, but nothing ever helped. By that time my ADD symptoms became much more apparent and began to hold me back in school and life in general. Zoning out, easily distractible, terrible working memory, poor verbal expression, thinking quickly, things that a lot of people take for granted. I began taking Vyvanse about 2 years ago at the 30mg and then 60mg daily doses, and while it helped a bit it wasn't great and mostly just gave me overall energy, but not necessarily mental efficiency. It also gave me heart palpations and tachycardia. Then i switched to 20mg Adderall XR twice daily about 12-18 months ago, and it seems about the same as the Vyvanse. I later added 80mg Straterra as well, with no perceivable difference to me (maybe more irritable?). Good energy booster, and it seems to help motivate me, like beginning difficult or monotonous tasks (aka homework) isn't climbing mount everest anymore, but the palpations and tachycardia are still there. It does seem to have slightly helped my working memory (sometimes), concentration (sometimes), and motivation (consistently, but not totally). Again, it's not a miracle, but as bad as ADD makes me feel most of the time, i'll take what i can get."

I am a stay at home mother and was never able to get focused on one thing exp. finishing dishes.  Now my house is in order and i have plenty of time to do the more important things with my children instead of being allover the place worrying about things that I forgot to do or started and not finished."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-07,adderall xr,Male,"I have ADHD PI (ADD I). I was on Adderall XR for about 3 years. It did help me focus but the side effects were awful. I really found out after I went off of the drug, which wasn't hard at all for me. I was off medication completely for 3 years and went back on Ritalin this time. I now only take 15mg of Ritalin as opposed to 25mg of Adderall and I can focus enough to do my work and still go to sleep at night. For those of you who have ADD I (not hybrid or hyperactive) and are experiencing side effects I definitely recommend trying other forms of stimulants. It might take some time to find the right match (like finding the right girlfriend or wife) but it is so worth the effort.  "

Now I am able to accomplish whatever I wish to do with focus and energy.  And since I suffer from treatment-resistant depression, Adderall XR serves the additional purpose of relieving my depression (with the only downside being that the depression returns once the med wears off).  It also has a 3rd benefit by reducing appetite, so I have been able to lose some much-needed weight.    "

He is on Adderall XR 10mg daily. I have found that this drug is very effective in reducing the ADHD symptoms, but he becomes very emotional and has almost no appetite while taking this medication. I have chosen not to give this medication on weekends and holidays when he is not in school because of this.I wish that thier would be a drug developed for ADHD that did not have these side effects.

If you are on a too high dosage you will get ticks, shakes, or difficulty breathing. DO NOT TAKE THE GENERIC! The salts are different in the medication and cause it to release differently.

My ability to concentrate is not significantly different when I don't take it in comparison to when I do take the medication. I really wish my parents put me in behavior therapy instead, because that would've been a lot more effective than medication. It also affects my breathing abilities, which makes it hard to enjoy playing sports and working out.

I seem to always be coughing, as if something is stuck in my throat, and swallowing at times seems difficult. I have actually had a cluster of inflammed tastebuds on my tongue (which hurt) because of the constant trying to swallow. However, the benefits are really great. I can tell a huge diffrence in my studying and concentration. I dont feel sluggish, and keeping up w two children takes alot out of you. Studying isnt as hard.

I've only taken 2 does so far (I'm on 20mg daily) and after the first dose I noticed some dizziness and slight loss of balance.  Today I noticed some heaviness in my head.  Last night I had trouble winding down to sleep.  I've been easily irritated both days and quick to cry (have stress in my life already).  I have had energy to organize and clean the house a lot in the past 2 days.  So far it's good, the dizziness was very mild periodically throughout the day yesterday and I have a history of dizziness with even simple medications, so this was a side effect for me. "

She recently put me on adderall because I have returned to college and found it impossible to stay on task. Within 24 hours, I felt like someone had lifted a wet, wool blanket off my body and my mind. I know that there are risks to this drug, but it really changed my life. Headache has been my most bothersome side effect, with some trouble sleeping but there's no way I would ever go back to where I was before."

19-24,Other,2023-03-26,adderall xr,Female,"My doctor put me on Adderall XR because I am on another medication that is hard to taper off, and makes me exhausted. So the Adderall was for the purpose of giving me energy and keeping me focused. I know that sounds bad, to fix symptoms with more meds, but my doctor and I gave it a shot. Adderall gets a bad rap, understandably. I used to be addicted to uppers, which made me nervous about taking amphetamines. Believe it or not, it doesn't trigger any of the ""high"" feelings. I take 30 mg as prescribed, no more than that. It doesn't make me speedy or irritable. It doesn't kill my appetite. What it does do, is help me get out of bed in the morning and want to do things I procrastinate on. It helps my short term memory and I stay on task. I take it in the morning and excersise later at night, so my heart rate isn't up too high before working out. I really haven't had problems with this medication and I can go without taking it, I don't feel a dependency on it. This is my own experience taking this, and I know everybody has different reactions to medication. It's helped to rid the effects of my antidepressants which make me tired, apathetic and sleepy. I don't advocate taking medication for any purpose besides helping to let a person participate in their life to the fullest, and this has helped me do just that. "

The effects are extremely subtle but I've noticed I am able to focus better without the rush and without noticing when the drug wears off.  The subtlety of Adderall XR's effects is what makes it a perfect prescription for me.  It also does not raise my blood pressure.  I am going to try not to take it on the weekends and see if I experience any ""withdrawal"" symptoms.  Otherwise, I have had no side effects."
65-74,Other,2023-05-20,adderall xr,Female,"EEg tests showed my brain was 90% asleep and Addeerall XR was prescribed.

It has been a blessing for me."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-06,adderall xr,Female,"My son was just recently diagnosed with ADHD at 7 years old.  He is now taking 10mg of Adderall XR every morning.  His focus and concentration both at home and at school has improved dramatically.  Only side effects are occasional nightmares...but only if he's overtired.  He'll wake up a few hours after going to bed and with about 30 minutes of random crying.  This has subsided the longer he's on the meds.  It was happening at least once a week, to now only once every 6 weeks or so.  His appetite is still good, although he looks very thin.  
Since watching my son's improvements on Adderall XR, I am now currently going through an ADHD evaluation to take care of it for myself.  I've had it my whole life, runs in my family...but was never treated.  Due to that, I could never keep a job or even finish school (no matter how many times I tried to go back).  I am 30 years old and thanks to my son and his efforts with ADHD, I'm about to change my life as well. "

45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-20,adderall xr,Female,"My son is 13 and has been on this for several years.  He is doing fine in school - and could do a commercial for why this drug helps kids in a school environment (the teachers all agree).  The negative is, trouble falling asleep, then trouble getting up in the morning.  For a teenager, he doesn't get enough sleep.  On weekends, he'll sleep till 11 easily.  He's missed school because he can't get out of bed.  Its almost like his body crashes every 10-15 days.  I don't know how to fix that.  He likes how he feels when he's not on the medicine (he has more energy).  He knows how much it helps him concentrate.  It definitely makes him moody and intollerant at times.  But without it - that's just exaggerated too.  Adderal XR is a necessary evil i'm afraid.  Tried many others before sticking with Adderal XR."

But my right leg is longer than my left leg. and over the many years has given me cronic hip-joint pain and extreme back pain. Even not on the drug, getting off waiting tables all day, my spine, yes my spine is killing me to the point i have to lay on the bed on my stomach with ice which helps, because i thuogh heat would help but it didn't. I've had my back x-rayed and the dr. said dhe could a vertibraite popped out of place and groubd into a different shape, from being popped out of place for so long. Then she said she could see that i had an authritic back and that my bone density that she saw in the x-ray, was sufficiently losing density. SO, i told this to my pysch., who prescribes me my adderall, this about my back pain and she said it will go away. Then when I go to the hospital when my back really hurts, they think I'm just trying to med seek for pain killers. I'm 26 and look a little younger for my age and I think that has something to do with it. I don't know, I just want the pain to stop."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-13,adderall xr,Female,"Im a 22 year old female, and I have been prescribed adderall for 6 years now. It has helped me lose 80lbs in 18 months which I am fine with! It makes me very irritable and short tempered, and if I do not take it for 2 days I feel worthless. If I miss one day, it's not terrible because I still feel it from the day before. I have never gotten the greatest sleep on it, but have learned to deal with it. I've found it to be extremely addictive and I would NOT recommend it. I have a complete love-hate relationship with this medicine. Without it though, I'm not sure I would've graduated high school on time, and am now currently about to graduate college in may. I have an 18 month old son and I did NOT take it during pregnancy, and I did start taking it immediately after he was born, due to lack of milk anyway. I was not able to breastfeed. It has helped tremendously with the ability to keep up on the demands of a toddler, school full time, and recovering from major back surgery. Downsides for me based on personal experience are: dry mouth, excessive sweating, dizziness, sleepless nights on occasion, COST if not covered by insurance, heart palpitations, extremely tight back muscles in the evening, teeth gritting, and anger/frusteration. It has helped me in so many ways, but also has many side effects, and due to the fact that it is so addicting, I wouldn't recommend it to people under 21. "
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-01,adderall xr,Male,"Adderall XR has been a significant medication in helping me focus, be more patient, and less angry due to frustration.  I was recently diagnosed with ADHD at 47.  This diagnosis certainly accounts for my behaviors and now is more clear.  I truly felt like I have been cheated in life not being able to reach my potential, now better late than ever finding out the causes."
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-07,adderall xr,Female,"After struggling with undiagnosed ADHD all my life I finally have peace. Better relationships, (more emotional control, better interactions with others), I retain a lot more information & my ability to concentrate and complete tasks has greatly improved(very helpful at work & school). I was little shakey in the beginning, and that went away after a few days. Definately had to cut back on my caffine! I am grateful to my Dr. & adderall."

I believe it is a wonderful drug, It has helped me and my son. Thank you "

I've been taking it for 3 years now & it has changed my life. I am not addicted to it, I don't take it when its unnecessary (i.e. no work/school/studying). The only thing that bothers me is that people who don't take it & dont understand just assume its bad for me, which makes me feel like im taking speed (which I guess it kind of is), not to mention the movie ""requiem for a dream"" (dont watch that lol sometimes I feel like the old lady). Anyways, does anyone think they should be worried that its a legal version of speed? Or do most think it is truly for medical purposes & unlike illegal drugs, there is a positive reason for it?"

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-11,adderall xr,Female,"I have to agree with everyone that reccommends Adderall. It has changed my life, although I understand that everyone is different and reacts to everything very differently. You have to take that into consideration when reading these reviews. 

I always felt like there was something not right with me until my Phyc. suggested the Adderall. First I was put on a  Regular Dose of 10mg in the morning and a 10mg in the afternoon (which I hated cus I'm terrible at taking my pills), so we switched to 20mgXR. Things has changed drasticly. I can focus, Im not chronicly late anymore, which then disposes of my road rage. My work is off the charts (Im a hairstylist), because I can really focus and listen to my clients. Before I always had a million things running through my head and couldnt get my shit together. I obvioulsy have more energy, and I do have to say that my anxiety and depression have lessened. I think eveyone gets anxious, its just a part of life, it doesnt mean you have something wrong with you.

So side effects, signifigant weight loss, 12lbs since November, Im not complaining. I do have loss of appitite during the day and def am hungry when I get home. I notice my mouth is always dry. But I have no problem getting to bed. And I really don't have dependency issues, some times on Sundays I don't even take it.

So that's that, It works for me, may not work for you. But you have to try things to know how you'll react!"

It really helps that I only have to take one XR in the morning.  Like many an ADDer I have problems remembering things.  More often than not, I would forget to take my afternoon dose of regular Adderall, or if I did remember I would find that I had forgotten to bring the meds me.  My prescription drug provider used to charge $10 per month for both versions of Adderall.  Now they charge $10 for the regular and $260 for XR.  My doctor is filing an appeal, but if it does not work it may be worth it to me to bite the bullet and pay through the nose so that I can stay on the XR."
55-64,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-20,adderall xr,Female,"perscribed to my 7yr old to help function at school... I am very concerned that this is habit forming although the Dr has told me it is out of the system in a day. It works pretty well but I don't want him to be addicted to this. Was also told by a nutrician it ""shrinks"" brain cells. Scarry."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-15,adderall xr,Male,I take 20 mg a day and it does help me to focus somewhat on my tasks at hand. I have read many reviews and think maybe I could up the dose a bit. I'll have that discussion with my doc. 
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-27,adderall xr,Female,"I have been taking Adderall XR, 50mg/day (30 in the morning, 20 in the afternoon) for about four years.  Before that, I took Dexedrine.  With the exception of ages 18-21, I took some form of stimulant since age 13.  

Adderall is highly addictive.  I feel it has ruined my life.  I loved the euphoric feeling and weight loss side effects, but it was so addictive I broke down and took it during my last trimester of pregnancy and now I fret it has caused a disproportionately small head size in my11-week-old daughter.  (weight and length are off the charts but head is only 50th percentile, and was only 25th percentile at birth)

It was also so addictive I quit breastfeeding at 5 weeks to go back on the meds.

Now it's causing dry mouth to the point of receding gums and ruining my teeth, and I'm still considering going back on it.  (when I realized the affect it was having on my dental health -- I quit taking it, and that was 2 days ago.  The fatigue from the withdrawal is crushing.)

I wish my parents had never started me on these meds.  

Please, parents, do not start your kids on these meds.  Their ADD can be an asset -- there are different perceptions of this 'disorder'.  They are better at multitasking and can hyperfocus when they are truly passionate about something...

The drugs are a gateway to a nightmare.  

There is no magic bullet."
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-25,adderall xr,Male,"Some practical advice: 1) be rigorously honest with yourself as to whether you have a TRUE, objective diagnosis of ADHD! 2) heed the warnings about using this drug is you have ANY issue with addictive behavior.
I probably do have ADHD but I am convinced that my use of Add over 2 years contributed to my life spinning out of control. I became impulsive, sometimes agressive, etc; started drinking excessively to ""come down"", mind was moving too fast to deal with life issues. Be wary of statement on this website that benefits should outweigh side effects! For me, it was great for a while but wow, did it help me mask life and land in a ditch (literally as during one episode I totalled my vehicle). Remember that the generic name is ""amphetamine"" and this is, for me, just a nicely packaged pharmaceutical called ""speed"". I'm now dealing with life on life's terms; not perfect, but drug free and I pray I never go back!  Again, rigorous honesty!"
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-27,adderall xr,Female,"My daughter's been on Adderall for a couple months now...10 mgs.  I thought it was working, but noticed some hysteria in getting a blood test done (after 3 attempts, we still haven't succeeded).  When she comes ""down"" from the meds, she really cycles out of control.  We just had our last and final episode of the med...she totaly ""wigged out""....worse than the previous hysteria...all about cleaning her room.  It took my husband and me 45 min to calm her down.  She was mentally and physically exhausted.  We were terrified by what we witnessed.  She's only been off the med since Sat., but so far she's feeling better.  I'm scard to try something else, afraid of what those side effects might be.  We also read about Adderall being taken off the Canadian market because of severe side effects, including death.  Unfortunately, this didn't warrant its removal from the US market and I only learned about this AFTER the troubles my daughter went through."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-25,adderall xr,Female,"I wish I could give this drug 0 stars for satisfaction.  I have been taking Adderall XR for over 3 years.  I am now considering changing to a different ADHD med.  Here's why:

When I filled my prescription for DAW (dispense as written) name brand Adderall XR, the pharmacist showed me that all the pills in the name brand bottle were all imprinted with M. Amphet. Salts - just like the generic. She even opened a new bottle, to show me that Walgreens wasn't trying to screw me over.

I called Shire and they said that the FDA approved Shire imprinting the name brand capsules with either ADERALL XR or M. Amphet. Salts and that as long as my prescription came from a name brand bottle that said ""Shire"" that I was taking the same name brand drug I've been taking all along.

I HIGHLY doubt what I've been taking for the past few days is regular name brand Aderall XR. I have been experiencing headaches, as well as, tight/clenched upper back muscles, tingling/numbness in my face and pressure behind my eyes. I also feel like I'm on something - I never felt like I was on something when I took name brand Adderall XR before!

I called Shire again and again they told me that as long as my prescription came from a bottle that said ""Shire"" that I was taking the same name brand drug.  Shire is lying."
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-11,adderall xr,Male,"My son (10yr.old) has been on this drug for 5 years. He is currently at 30mg. It manages his ADHD great but the side effects (nightmares, constipation) are getting worse. Any help?"

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-15,adderall xr,Female,I take Adderall XR for ADHD. It does help me focus but I still can't focus on just one task. My mind still jumps from one thing to anouther & sometimes i feel like i'm in a zone. My mind seems to stay really focused but still can't finish things I start.
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-15,adderall xr,Male,"I was one of the ritalin medicines for many years but it gave me issues with high blood pressure at 27.  After 3 years of different medicines, I found that Adderall XR 25mg could suppress my ADHD and I could also maintain my blood pressure.  Another positive side effect for me has been weight loss.  Since being on Adderall, I have lost 65lbs (was previously borderline obese) and have maintained a healthy weight ever since."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-25,adderall xr,Female,"I take Adderall XR 30 mg the genertic version and have been on it for almost a year. It works great, I am more focused, attentive,organized and consistent. I have very few if any side effects, I sleep fine at night, I've noticed it doesn't last a full 12 hours, so I take it around 9- 10 am to last during the time of day that I need it. I wish that while I was in school that I would have noticed how hard it was for me, and that even with my best efforts and trying so hard that had I taken this medication  I would have probably been more sucessful. It has made all the difference for me. "
55-64,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-10,adderall xr,Female,Finding Adderall XR has been like divine intervention for me. I have severe ADHD that runs in my family. My brother has ADD and my sister has hyperactivity without the inattentiveness that she finds highly adaptive. My nephew (brother's son) took Adderall with great results for many years. Although I have had a lifelong history of ADHD (and was in special ed) I had always been misdiagnosed. I won't even go into the crazy things I was labelled with. Despite such a grim prognosis I was able to complete grad school with a 4.0 average at USC and obtain a professional license in health care. When I tried to obtain meds for ADHD this was used against me and I was told that I could not be this successful with severe ADHD and was even labelled bi-polar by the chief of neurology due to my hyperactivity which has become worse when I turned 50. Finally a colleague prescribed Strattera which not only made my sick it also gave me nightmares. Next was Concerta which worked great but gave me such severe dry mouth that it destroyed my mucous membranes. Recently I switched to Adderal. By this time I was saying my prayers. It works great! I had mild dry mouth that was self-limiting and am on top of my game. The best thing is the improve social skills due to < impulsivity and the improved concentration. I am a new woman! Thank you shire. I take 20 mg QAM and 10 mg in the afternoon. It also decreases my PTSD symptoms. From reading the posts my experience appears unusual and I hope it encourages adults.   
 ,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-09,adderall xr,Male,"I've tried Vyvanse, Strattera and concerta for my ADHD.  Adderall XR is the best hands down.  Strattera didn't work at all and the concerta was ok but didn't last 12 hours like it's supposed to, plus my liver enzymes tested high on it.  Vyvanse gave the worse sides.  My eyes were always bloodshot and I was always paranoid.  I feel at ease and can focus and concentrate for long periods of time at school and work.  For people that legitmitally have ADD/ADHD like me, this drug works wonders, provided that you take it properly and DO NOT crush the beads and snort it or inject it.  It is meant to be taken orally and create and acheive a steady baseline level so there aren't as many highs and lows throughout the day.  One side effect I have found out to be negative is that it takes me 2 hours to fall asleep at night.  Aside from that, I now live a normal life and excel in both school and work.  "
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-27,adderall xr,Female,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in 3rd grade.  I really did affect me through out my elementary, middle school life because I thought I was different from my other class mates in a bad way.  I soon realized in high school that my disorder wasn't all that bad and that being different is being beautiful.  I started Adderall when i was in 9th grade I believe and it changed my life for the better immediately, it helped me focus, be a better person, and not completely annoy people =]. This pill truly saved my academic life and my personal life as well.  Thank you to whoever invented Adderall and I recommend it to all who has ADHD."
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-21,adderall xr,Female,I am 18 years old. I took Adderall XR from 7th grade all the way up through high school. It worked wonderfully. I was always more focused on my schoolwork and I didn't feel as tired when I took the pill. My side effects only consisted of this: Extreme loss of appetite (I was usually only hungry once a day). I lost alot of weight while I was using Adderall XR.
55-64,Other,2023-05-24,adderall xr,Female,"I was not prescribed Adderall for ADD or ADHD. I am taking several medications that make me very tired and lethargic, have gained weight easily and often feel as though I never slept at night. My psychiatrist told me that people who work night shift or other than day schedules sometimes benefit from Adderall. I was prescribed 10mg 3X/day but rarely take that much. In fact, I usually only take it in the morning, particularly when I've had little/no sleep or it was not restful sleep. It really helps me get going and get things accomplished... which in turn makes me feel productive. The only side effect I notice is a headache in the late afternoon. I am careful to refrain from taking it too close to bedtime, or I won't be able to sleep. I didn't know and did not experience the appetite suppressant effect. Maybe that only works with higher doses than I'm taking. Thanks to everyone who wrote in. It really helps to  read about other people's experiences . "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-04,adderall xr,Female,"I am 24 years old & have had ADHD me entire life. I refused to take meds forever because I was stubborn, now my doc gave me Adderall. I take 20mgs XR daily & have made a complete change in my attentiveness & hyperactivity. The side effects at first were tough, but after about 2 weeks I was fine... My side effects now are occasional headaches, dry mouth, increased sex drive (weird, I know), and I find if I take the meds on the weekends when I don't wake up until 10-11am, I don't feel very good the rest of the day. Overall, it's been great for me!"
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-05,adderall xr,Female,"After being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder WITHOUT Hyperactivity 5 years ago, my Psychiatrist prescribed Adderall for me. I fluctuated between 30 and 45 mg (one 30 in the morning, and a 15 in the afternoon) and eventually found the 30 to be sufficient. Although I am very satisfied with this medication, for someone such as myself who has difficulty remembering things, it is definitely a bit difficult to remember to take with painful consequences if forgotten.

Also, it is important to eat immediately after taking the pill or else serious nausea and stomach pain could occur. However, I have been off the medication for the past year and am now back on it."
3-6,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-29,adderall xr,Male,Pediatrician put my 6yr old on this med and with his first dose he had bad reaction banging his head all over and flipping out . Just with one dose and not sleeping at all tonite. Whining  I will never put him on this meds again or another until he is older.
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-11,adderall xr,Female,"I am 25 and have been on Adderall XR since I was 14. Adderall has worked very well for me. Some of the benefits for me are increased focus, ability to effectively process information and form and express coherent thoughts more effectively. When I am on my medicine, I find it easier to complete tasks, whereas without the medication, completing even the easiest of tasks (like unpacking groceries) is difficult because I get sidetracked. When I am not on my medicine I tend to exhibit a lot of impulsive behaviors, but on my medicine, I am better able to think before I act, so to speak. Another benefit is that I am not bored as frequently. One obvious negative side effect is loss of appetite. I lost a lot of weight in the first year or so of being on Adderall. I could easily go for a day without eating. I just didn't look healthy. Some of my family members and teachers thought I had become anorexic and were getting worried. After I graduated college, I went off Adderall for about a year and hated it. I gained back the weight I had lost plus more because of nervous/bored eating, and I struggled in school (in my masters program), at work, and some of my relationships with others suffered. I have been back on Adderall XR for about 3 months now and am much happier with life in general. I just feel more balanced and in control of myself, which is nice. I have noticed decreased appetite, but to a MUCH lesser extent than in high school and college. Some of the negative side effects I have always experienced while on the drug are decreased sex drive (although that has improved), dry mouth, and what I call ""hyper-focus"" - the inability to switch from one task to another. The effectiveness of AdderallXR obviously varies from person to person, as do the positive and negative side effects. THough I have had some negative side effects, my overall experience with AdderallXR has been VERY positive."
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-29,adderall xr,Female,"Don't use it for concentation.  Take a nap or a walk.  There are actually real medical reasons to use it.  If your not eating then make a note to remind your self to eat, if you have dry mouth drink more fluids.  If you can't sleep try a snack before bed or a warm bath or maybe you're dose is too high.  You shouldn't go OCD from it. I've been misdiagnosed for over 3 years and this is year 4 and I've started a new dr and the generic form of Adderall XR and since I've never taken anything else I can't compare it with the label or any other type stimulant.  I've started on 10mg and will be on 20mg next week.  I can sleep, eat and have been slowly teaching myself to slow down and pay attention to what I'm doing and to listen better.  It also has been on the market for years and the side effects are small compared to some you may not even know exist until later. :)"
 ,Other,2023-01-17,adderall xr, ,"I am taking this drug for ADD.  I can now read a book through, sit and do wordsearches and follow thru with tasks.  I am more alert and don't forget things as easily.  I am more motivated."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-12,adderall xr,Female,"After taking Strattera for a year for my adult ADHD, and being incredibly sick and nauseous because of it, I've found Adderall XR to be much better at helping me focus and concentrate--without the horrible side effects of Strattera.

Adderall XR does seem to inhibit my ability to fall asleep, and I've found I need to take it no later than 7 am in order to be asleep by 11 pm. Adderall XR does not seem to control my random leg-bouncing or foot-shaking, but it does significantly improve my ability to concentrate on tasks and during conversations. I'm completely satisfied."
25-34,Other,2023-05-27,adderall xr,Female,I Have been on Adderall XR for approx.6 yrs. now I take 20mgs. 2x daily. I have always made sure to follow my doctors directions with this medication and it has really helped me. I take it the same time every day and I do not feel the need to ever increase my dose. I do hate however the way I am judged by pharmacists when I pick up my med. like it is heroin!! I have to get a new script every month they really make you feel like a drug addict sometimes due to all the kids/adults abusing this med. 
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-20,adderall xr,Male,I take two 30 mg pills a day. First one at 6am and second at 2pm. This drug has completely changed my life and basically helped me save my marriage. I could not stay focused and my memory was horrible. So much better know. My only worry is taking so much for such a long period of time and the long term side effects. Going on 8 months of two pills everyday. Hate to miss because it makes such a difference in my everyday life!

BUTTTT, I am so irratated and mean when it wears off, and its really hard for me to be nice. I've noticed this happens to almost ALL of my friends. Also, it seems to give me a sort of OCD, my room use to be SO messy, and now everything has to be in its place. You get so so so focused on one thing, that you can lose track of time. If I weren't in college and didn't need to focus so intensly I probably wouldn't take it. "

35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-23,adderall xr,Female,"Adderall XR is a miracle drug. DAW, The generic form can not even come close to the name brand. I spent the first part of my life in a complete fog, I might as well of been sleeping. Adderall XR ""woke me up"",my knowledge base began the day I started Adderall. I am very greatful for the medication, I hope the company never stops making it.  "
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-18,adderall xr,Female,"Have been on this medication only a month, but the difference is VERY noticeable. Have narcolepsy in addition to ADHD, and as an adult who has never been treated or diagnosed until recently, didn't know my issues were so severe. My psychiatrist recommended it and I take 10mg per day. Since beginning it, I have less distractability, more focus, more concentration, easier time remembering tasks, not losing things anymore or misplacing things.
The few things that have slipped away are the racing thoughts, the negative outlook on all things in life, and my inability to sleep through the night. I am glad they have. I can concentrate more. However, it has also taken muscle spasms away and now I can feel every bit of my fibromyalgia pain. So in conjunction with Adderall XR, I take Lagnasil (Lamotrygiene) and have a muscle relaxer (Xanax) which helps with the pain at night. Overall, my cognitive reasoning and function has VASTLY improved. If you suffer from ADHD, I hope you give this a try and see if it works as well for you."

I have just finished the detox from Klonopin and with the help of my psychiatrist who prescribes medication based on FACT (he takes a EEG of your brain and reads the brains waves in order to prescribe the correct medication to have your brain working optimally) I am now taking Adderall XR and find after being prescribed every SSRI, Benzo, Mood stabilizer under the sun that this is more helpful than any SSRI or benzo"

35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-29,adderall xr,Female,"This medication works great for me.  I have no side effects. I sleep better than before, have a regular appetite, no dry mouth, no mood swings. I take only 10 or 15 mg per day. I'm sure I could take more for better concentration and to stay on task easier, but I take the minimal amount of medication I need to enable me to use the other coping skills I have developed. This drug should be used to help ADD symptoms, it's not a cure. We need to learn skills to deal with our ""handicap"". Taking medication can take away enough of the noise and chaos to allow us to learn coping skills. For some who have described negative symptoms, try cutting back a little at a time, it may be a little harder to concentrate but it may eliminate the negative effects and still give some positive relief for ADD.

For me, if I don't remember to take it, I will feel like I could run laps around the world, and I develope headaches. Over all, this is a great RX that can really change you life!"

I was up nice and early in the morning and it kept me going throughout the day. At first I noticed I had to eat. After a few months on the drug, I starting getting headaches when (I realized) the drug was wearing off. I started on the regular release tablets at 10mg, started taking 15 mg XR, now I am on 30mg XR twice a day. I have built up an incredible resistance to the drug...but even if I don't take it I am a total wreck. The last few months I've been very depressed, anxious and just plain old down in the dumps. I don't even want to leave the house. I am thinking about switching to a new drug, but I am nervous it will not initially help me like adderall once did. Very, very addictive drug. I would not recommend it to anyone who couldn't deal with the jitters, loss of appetite and difficulty getting to sleep. But it does eventually go away. I just don't recommend it for long-term use."

19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-23,adderall xr,Female,"I was on Adderall XR for about 2 years. At first it was good especially the whole weight loss thing. But then I just started feeling like I was on crack. (even though I know, it pretty much is crack) I became so immune to the positive effects like being able to concentrate. But the bad side effects always stayed. I was nauseous all the time, I couldn't eat and became very underweight, my mouth always felt dry no matter how much water I drank. Eventually I would dread taking the medicine when I woke up because I knew what I was in for. My doc recently switched me to Vyvanse which works just the same, but without the extreme crash and extreme bad side effects. I will never get back on Adderall, ever!  "

So I deal with the sleep problems as best I can."

When I take 20mg before class or before I go to work, I feel like a completely different person--in a good way. I do not take it everyday, unlike some people. I take it when I know I'll need it-like at school. One day, I forgot to take the medicine before classes and I could not focus one bit. I never realized how bad my focus is until that day. People all around were talking and I could not get my mind out of all the conversations. When I take the medicine and people are talking around me-I can block them out and focus like nothing else. My side effects include dry mouth, canker sores from dry mouth, little appetite. "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-12,adderall xr,Male,19-24 female beneath me. I can't say enough bad things about Adderall. I do know that some people truly do need it though. If you do want to come off of it I would suggest your Dr. slowly taper you off of it. And ask for a rx of Provigil or Nuvigil to help you stay awake and alert during the day. These two drugs are intended for alertness and narcolepsy. They just aren't an amphetamine. Hope this helps if you do wish to stop adderall. Happy health. - B. Anonymous
55-64,Other,2023-06-16,adderall xr,Male,"History: I have had the symptoms of narcolepsy since childhood. First memories I can recall is around 5 years of age. 
I did not get it officially diagnosed until I was 50 years old.  I knew the stigma of Narcolepsy would interfere with job searching. 
My new Neurologist is a sleep studies specialist. He is aware on how ineffective the Amphetamines react within me. No side effects, slight increase in heart rate and slight rise on the BP. No burst of energy or any other effects.  I am now on a base prescription of adderall and adderall XR combination at 160mg per day. At times the ranges may go as far up to 240mg or down to only several.  The amount of the dosage is directly dependent of the day’s requirements.  I also try to take 1-2 days of Adderall free days to lessen the problem of drug tolerance.  The adderall still at the high dose performs very poorly in managing my microsleeps. I can take a full dose, wait 45 minutes, then lie down and fall asleep. I am also on Xyrem treatments for the last 5 months.  Xyrem is not working very well.  I have been diagnosed as a right clinical context narcolepsy.  I unfortunately am one of the exceptions to the effectiveness of amphetamines and the like. Even from the beginning, the amphetamines have had little effect on my body. History:  I was never a drug user and I never liked to drink alcohol. I still don't drink or use recreational drugs.  Never had any of the 'so called side effects' that amphetamines can give someone at the higher dose. In the past I have had provigil and ritlan with no effective treatment. If the above appears to be disassociated, I had more than several microsleep episodes trying to get this written.

19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-24,adderall xr,Female,"I have been taking this medication as long as I can remember. As far as my ADD is concerned, it works wonders. However, I get extremely fixated while doing things (such as browsing the web and cleaning) and will often do them for over 5 hours without stopping. It has caused me anxiety, a misdiagnosis of a heart mutation due to my high heart-rate (caused by the medication), teeth grinding, and frequent sleep problems. Also, the withdrawal symptoms are very severe and I often can not even stay awake during the day if I do not take it. Overall, the benefits do outweigh the side effects and I feel that I will be continuing to take this medication for a very long time."
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-11,adderall xr,Male,"I'm 47 years old and was diagnosed late with ADD.  School was a nightmare, barely got though college.  No ability to work towards a goal, concentrate, or stay organized.  Originally diagnosed an treated for dep./anx. in my thirties, but it was my ADD that caused these issues.  Started taking 20mgs. of Adderrall.  I'm enjoying life now as never before because because it helps me focus, organize, and want to interact more with people.  My only worry is that I hear Canada has banned it because of risk of stroke, heart problems, and hardening of the arteries.  I'm going to ask mo doc about it.  Another worry, my five year old (I have four kids under seven) seems to be just like his old man.  I would be devastated to have to put him on this during his physical development.  We'll see how kindergarten goes.  For adults with true ADD, it could drastically change your life for the better!  Did mine.     "
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-22,adderall xr,Female,"I started taking this medicine 3 years ago. The pros are: ability to concentrate and complete tasks (my GPA went from a 1.6 to 3.9), energy throughout the day.
Cons: Loss of appetite (I'm 5'5 105), headaches, irritability and when I don't take it I'm exhausted. "
19-24,Other,2023-03-04,adderall xr,Male,"My experience with this treatment is well above my expectations I had. I have Insomnia which is a sleeping disorder, it doesn't help that much when you take it later in the day. Some people take the Adderall XR in the morning and then take the instant release form of the medication in the afternoon/evening. I highly do NOT recommend that kind of treatment. Especially to people who don't already have a sleeping disorder such as Insomnia/RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) I also have Paranoia,Major depression,Anxiety,Panic attacks and phobias. I take 30 MG Adderall XR one time in the morning get that good feeling then the feelings just kinda melt away, and leave me somewhere in the middle of the day. Also again I highly don't recommend taking Any form or MG of Adderall in the evening hours if you don't already have a sleeping disorder cause it ""will"" cause you to stay up later than normal and develop a habit that unfortunately 9-10 times can not be self medicated in anyway to fix. You cause yourself to get Insomnia trust me you don't want to have Insomnia. It will make you more tired during the day worsen Depression if you don't already have it you will when you have Insomnia you will be more agile, and frustrated,Angry at the world blah blah blah. Something I'm going to try and do Is take the 30 MG Adderall XR closer to noon. Therefor I should be covered for the whole day and then be ready for bed at a normal hour. The Adderall helps me with my mood,Depression,Anxiety,Panic Attacks. Not my Phobias in case your wondering what my Phobias are. Here you go get ready to laugh cause they may seem innocent and true for a lot of people, and may seem like I don't have phobias their normal. Believe me I think their funny too so don't think if you laugh at some of these your going to hurt my feelings. All these ""phobias"" triggers me to bust out in anger and have ""panic attacks"" some sometimes and some most of the time. The way Old people drive,food in a sink,peoplewalkingbehindme loll"
13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-25,adderall xr,Male,"I have been taking Adderall XR for a couple years now, and I have to say, this drug is a miracle and a demon at the same time. I have had every negative side effect, as well has had a lot less trouble with school. Some of the negative things the medicine cause for me are Nausea, Headaches, Dizziness, Dry Mouth, nearly Fainting when standing, General fatigue/weakness, Muscle Tension, Muscle Spasms (Sometimes EXTREMELY painful, most pain I've experienced ever), Lack of sleep, restlessness, jiteriness, Some OCD-like symptoms (Obsessing over little annoyances), and that's not all. Even though this drug has brought me so many bad things, it has also been the only thing that allowed me to be successful in school, and not be so hyper-social. I honestly wouldn't recomend this drug for some one who hasn't tried other ADHD medicines without success, as they would probably be less troublesome, but for me, this is what worked. This drug is also NOT for some one who doesn't want negative side effects, as they seem abundant. The only problem really, is the consistency of negative side effects. For some they don't appear at all. I have found that this drug makes it so that when I stay up late, I don't get tired easily, and the next day it barely feels like I stayed up late. This can be a blessing and the opposite. For instance, I stayed up late once, and forgot to take my pills the next morning, and what resulted felt like being drunk, half dead, and like I hadn't slept for at least a couple days. All I could do is sleep, and I ended up so weak that I got sick. So, the moral of the story really is, Try Adderall, and if you get negative side effects, make sure there isn't an alternative medicine for you. "
19-24,Other,2023-02-06,adderall xr,Female,"I have ADD and I took this medication for over 4 years, from 8th grade, into the begining of college. The only side effect that I had while on this was the loss of appitite, but this was only when I skiped breakfast in the morning, or my dosage was raised. For new people on this, I suggest that you make sure you eat a good breakfast, because that was what got me though the day when it came to eating meals. I did lose weight while on this, but it did not become a problem because I watched it. Make your self aware that you are in control, if only you take the time to really take care of your self."

After i started Adderall, my mom saw a big difference in me.  i would actually listen when someone was speaking and not automatically thinking of a response.  my mom stated when she thought back on my childhood it made since that i had adhd.  i was never had the classic symptoms (acting out, bad in school, ...).  They never thought to test me.  i wish i would have been diagnosed as a child, i feel i was cheated out of of life.  maybe i would have completed college and not switched majors multi times.  instead, i am now working to support a child and i have 6 years or so of school i have completed but no degree.  if any parent is unsure, let their child try it.  trying it wont hurt anything, you can always take them off.  i wish i would have known or had the opportunity to decide on medicating, i may have made the wrong choice but at least i would have had a choice.  Adderall has helped me w/a lot of things.  i have better friendships b/c i am a clamer person.  at work i can actually sit still and get tasks done.  i have always got work/homework done but now i do it without thinking how much i dislike whatever i am doing, i can focus and get it done before i even think about how i feel about it.  i love adderall and never go without it!"

This med is great. Im immediately awake 20 min after I take it and I dont come down or get moody like other things that keep you awake.

I am currently working on my Degree in College. I had taken other ADHD medications which was like taking nothing. After speaking to my Doctor about other medications for ADHD, we decided to give this one a try. It is easy to use, It works for me, and I am completely satisfied. Some will say this is an evil drug and don't start it at all. Of those who say it is evil, I say talk to your Doctor and try something else until the right one is found for you. I no longer have a foogy brain, I can sit in class and not fidget..I understand and now retain what is said..and while yes I still get tired because I also have MS & Fibromyalgia just to name a couple of things, it works for me and I no longer need to sleep for 16 hours a day.

I have decided that the additional beneft of the reilious lease pails on companion to addreall xr being able to be used by results without the significant side effect of anxiety.


   this has got to be the way in which the ER version of the pills allows their levels in the blood to start and end at loewer fellings, therefore, minmizing he common side effects of increasing heart betts and blood pressure (which I have).

This medicine has helped me yet I can see how it can be habit forming.  For this reason I choose to only take the medication when and if I need it.
It doesn't necessarily bring about moodiness for me, though it does help me from getting distracted easily.  The way I would describe it in Layman's terms is; It gets me in the zone.

I can easily sum up Adderall xr by saying WOW!!  I used to be very very anti anything ADD/ADHD, I use to think it was a way for the pharmaceutical companies to ""push more drugs"" on us.  What changed my thinking was when my son was having a lot of trouble with school work and was diagnosed with ADHD.  I saw the exact same symptoms in him that I had when I was young.  I have always had trouble in school.  It wasn't that I wasn't interested I just couldn't stay focused long enough to get into the material.  I went and spoke with my family doctor, told him the situation, the symptoms I was having, my past school performance, current job performance, etc... and he decided to prescribe me Adderall xr 25mg.  Another thing he told me to do was to cut out ALL caffeine, which I did.  The first three days I popped Ibuprofen all the time because of caffeine withdrawal headaches but after that the transformation has been wonderful.  I have had anxiety problems with mild depression for as long as I can remember, actually anxiety runs on my side of the family.  Starting the first day with Adderall I could tell a big difference.  I had that euphoria that everyone writes about but my thinking, concentration, my ability to prioritize, and get things done has been AMAZING.  Now that I have been on the med for a little over 3 months the euphoria feeling is gone, that was gone in the first few days of use, but my ability to stay focused, concentrate, prioritize, and basically ""get er done"" has been excellent, actually after a month of being on the med it seemed like it improved somewhat again, I actually find myself speaking slower and more methodically.  I couldn't be happier.  I actually think that A LOT of my anxiety and mild depression have been related to my NOT being diagnosed with ADD sooner in my life.  Since starting this med I actually feel like a different person. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

Well, within months of starting the medication my employer created a new position for me as i was finally able to focus. My finances are getting back on track (paying stuff off instead of frivolous spending). Relationship i am working on but i am finally more focused on taking my career even further. I wish i would have taken this approach earlier in my life. I am now 33 and finally living my life the way i want. I used to sleep terrible, now i actually have no issues falling asleep (most of the time anyway).

I am a very normal productive person however, tasks like grocery shopping, laundry, cooking, things not mentally stimulating seemed to defeat me-  I never realized that it was frustration or being overwhelmed by the circumstances- I never rememberred my lists, got distracted, forgot items, then I'd become frustrated by my inability to do menial tasks- I could make a 4.0 in college but couldn't focus at the grocery store-  After my child was diagnosed with adhd,  and I started reading about add, I realized it was me too!  THe first day on this drug made me see what I had been missing all these years- I can focus on all types of things not just things that are of high interest to me!!  "

19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-28,adderall xr,Female,"OKAY, so I've been taking Adderall XR 10-15 mg for about 6 months now. Let me start off by saying, yes, my grades improved dramatically--moreso than they have in years.  However, I noticed that my anxiety has gotten worse. I will get paranoid about stupid things that aren't worth getting paranoid about.  Does anyone know why this is? Plus, when I first started taking it, I could tell that my heart rate was moving much faster. That was annoying.  AND it really freaks me out that the one of the warnings on the label says, ""May cause sudden death.""  WHHAAATTT???!!!  I guess it all depends on how many mg's you're taking, right?  I don't know how some people are taking over 100 mgs of this stuff!!! Maybe they just have really bad symptoms of ADHD. I don't think I could ever let myself take more than 10-15 mgs of this stuff. The label does warn consumers of heart problems and things like that, so I'll just stay at my current dosage.  It has helped me dramatically in school, though! YAY!!!"

My only problem is that it is only lasting 6 or 7 hours as apposed to the 8 to 12 that it is supposed to. I get all my house work done with out the feeling of being overwhelmed by all the cleaning and cooking and taking care of my daughter. It has been a God send!"
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-05,adderall xr,Male,"I am  a 38 year old male. My ADHD diagnosis at the age of 35 was liberating. I saw the 'top' doctor in NYC who charged $750 and saw me for 15 minutes to make the diagnosis - promptly prescribing Adderall RX. Each subsequent $250 session lasted less than 5 minutes to monitor my progress on the Adderall RX. Initially things were great. I was able to focus on tasks, I did not get drowsy driving and my appetite was manageable. I actually lost 12 pounds! I saw that as a positive side-effect. At the time I started, I read that Adderall RX was the new Hollywood diet drug, so I felt tres chic! Anyway, it took me a while to realize that Adderall RX was making me less tolerant with more feelings of rage. At one point, I broke a full length mirror in my wife's office by impulsively putting my shoe through it during a heated argument. I MUST NOTE THAT I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE!!! I also felt what I could only describe as a pain in my liver after several months of taking the drug. If I stopped temporarily, the pain went away. As soon as I resumed, the pain came back. Another leading NYC expert consulted with a top expert at Mt. Sinai, who had never heard of this side effect. Whether it was recorded or not, I had it and don't since stopping the med. My course on Adderall RX lasted about 9 months. I also was in a n ADHD group therapy class. In the end, I deceided that this is who I am, that drugs are not a miracle cure and that the pain in my liver and feeling enraged was not something that was worth the extra focus and appetite suppression. I do keep a stash for long driving trips, because it absolutely keeps me alert and I don't feel like I have to pull off the road to nap. Hope this helps. WOuld love to know if others felt this pain in their right side or, as I describe, my liver."

25-34,Other,2023-04-10,adderall xr,Male,"I have had ADD since childhood I began taking a low dose of Ritalin in elementary school. Through the years, I have had a need to up the dosage, finally transitioning into Adderall. I find the XR to be the most effective for my condition, due to its ability to slowly release the drug vs. having to take multiple pills. I am satisfied with the results of this drug. Although from time to time I do seem to have a slight jitter, usually if I have not eaten before taking the prescription. Aside from that, I would recommend this type of drug to those with a similar condition to mine.     "
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-30,adderall xr,Male,"I have been taking Adderall XR for nearly 5 years. I am now 41. I started on 20mg and noticed an immediate differance in my focus and energy. But soon the effectivness wore off and I went up to 40mg... then 60... then 80... then 100... then 120mg. I began to experience psychotic-like symptoms and my doctor pulled me back to 40mg. I dont feel like its doing anything for me anymore and I often find myself staring... just zoned out. You will always need more of this drug over time for it to actually work. It is highly addictive. I cant get out of the bed without it. It used to be my ""wonder drug"" in the beginning. I felt better and worked harder and smarter than I'd ever dreamed possible. Now I suffer with severe anxiety and cant focus on anything for very long. It causes irritability and keeps me from eating regular meals. But I am addicted to the energy it gives me and just today I told my psychiatrist not to take me off of it even though I have such bad anxiety. He isn't the same doctor that once prescribed 120mg. He really thinks I should come off of it. Deep down, I believe I should too. Sometimes, even on just 40mg I feel so wired. My eyes dilate, my hands are always cold and I shake. I have to take Lunesta 3mg to go to sleep at every night. I will say that Adderall XR was only a short-lived fix for me. I have never been hyperactive... just attention deficit. If you are taking it, maybe you will have better results than I have."

The medication had helped with my schoolwork and memory greatly (Im doing so much better!), but some of the side affects are bothersome. When I get fatigued, I feel like my head is fogged, causing me to space out and be unable to think straight. Also, if I dont take a dose for one day, I get drastic mood swings, and end up feeling very sad and depressed."

But, it is a very addictive drug. It turned me in to a zombie. I couldn't get out of bed without taking it and I was soo wired on it sometimes. We all have scatter brains and we all need to deal with it without having to rely on expensive pills!! they weren't around 50 years ago, and they survivied! I just think its horrible to drug up kids and people, it takes away from their real personality. Wouldnt suggest it to anyone."

35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-25,adderall xr,Male,"So far I have only been on Adderall XR for about a week.  The only side affects I've noticed are it seems like it takes me longer to fall asleep at night.  I think the drug has helped me immensely, I have been taking 20mg of Lexapro for about 4 years now and it has helped with my anxiety but my head always felt clouded, I always felt like ""my get up and go got up and went"".  I was always just sluggish and wanting to nap all the time.  My attention span was always very short and I became bored with things very fast, I was constantly punishing myself for daydreaming and trying to make myself focus.  The second day of being on Adderall XR was when I noticed the biggest differance, and it has been the same since starting.  My thinking is SO MUCH clearer.  The constant ""background noise"" of continuous thoughts is gone.  I was afraid when I started the drug I would feel like I was on a caffeine overdose, but it's not like that at all.  Your thoughts just clear, I even speak slower, I'm more focused on what is going on, I don't even think about taking a nap anymore, don't have a need to.  Things that I used to constantly procrastinate on just get finished.  Not only are you doing the things you didn't do before you have an enjoyment in doing them.  I have always felt that I was an anxious child growing up and I think that A LOT of my anxiety problems as an adult were definitely related to my ADHD.  So far I can't say anything bad about Adderall XR.  I take one 25mg capsule in the morning, eat breakfast and go about my day.  The only other medications I take are a multivitamin and a fish oil supplement at lunch and Lexapro 20mg before bed.  I would highly recommend Adderall XR especially if you have anxiety and depression.  Good luck to all. "

This is the first time to try stimulant medication and I can already tell the difference it is like I have come out of a 25 year fog!! I can't beleive the difference in the way I feel now from just 6 days ago! The only problem I had was when I took the meds the first day I took it to late in the evening after getting the medicine, about 3:00 and did not sleep all nite! After that I started taking it in the morning on a full stomach around 8:00. It seems not to bother me at all now. I do have to make myself eat about noonish or so,besides that it has already sarted having a drastic effect on the quality of my life! I feel like I have finally woke up from a nightmare!! "
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-17,adderall xr,Female,"Before i was prescribed Adderall XR, i was doing horribly in college, getting at the highest a c- in my classes. When i started on it however, my attention span and memory improved 10 fold. I started getting nothing less than an A in some very difficult upper division classes. I have noticed though, that i build a tolerence to it quite quickly, and am currently at 60 mgs a day, which causes me to get migrains and i definately dont feel hungry enough to eat. Lately i took a 'drug holiday' and stopped taking it (since im not currently in school or working).Being adderall free for a while has helped, and i know that when i decide to start taking it again, i will get the full effect all over again. It has definately changed my life, made me feel more intelligent, i just dont like the fact that it lasts so long in my body, and it makes it difficult to ever get any sleep without having to use sleeping meds."

Also, little things that would have bothered me before don't any more and I have become much more organized. When I first started taking it, I had trouble eating but that wore off after a few weeks. As long as I remember to take it everyday, it's great!"

I am currently unable to hold a job because I have terrible concentration skills and difficulty finishing tasks.  I got fired (again) and lost my health insurance.

Although he claims it has changed his life by enabling him to focus at work.  There is a severe downside to using this drug.  He suffers from  severe anxiety attacks, extreme mood swings, bursts of anger, lack of sex drive, depression, he is anti-social, he demonstrates obsessive compulsive disorder he suffers with extreme exhaustion, loss of appetite to binge eating. He can go from being emotionless to overly emotional. He suffers from convulsions during his sleep. His entire personality has changed since using this drug. It is very sad and disturbing to see him suffer this way. I do not recommend this drug to anyone."

I feel like i'm less witty on the medicine and less spontaineous, less creative. Yet, I am at ease, calmer since i've found the right dose (no more that 15 mg. a day). Before I took to high of a dose and developed severe anxiety. I stopped for a while, it eased off and I found the right dose. So far it is not addicting and helps just enough to increase motivation, clear my head and not bounce around flitting from one thing to the next - when i take it, I dont get bored nearly as fast. Thats really good in school."

Prior to taking this medication, I have always had difficulty concentrating and staying on task.  I have also changed jobs/careers frequently and was asked to resign from my last job in February. 

I have always had problems with insecurity and impulsiveness, and since my job loss, I have been depressed and anxious.  Adderall, with the combination of low doses of anxiety and depression medication, have made a huge difference.  I am able to focus like never before, stay on task, and have a much higher level of confidence.  "
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-27,adderall xr,Female,"Addiction. That about sums it up. Too much of a good thing. It was typical. It made me feel great. It made me feel as though life was worth living. I wrote, I focused, I read, then before I knew it, the crash would hit. And I would pop another one. At one point, I was up for FIVE DAYS with NO FOOD. Things start to go down hill on day 2. You can't focus as well, your nerves are shot. You are weak. But man, when that exhaustion hits, it's so scary. I did this off and on for months until one day my doctor said, ""No more."" This was because I finally told him, ""Im out and I feel like I'm dying!"" I was taken off large doses 60-80mg a day for 4 months COLD TURKEY. I was out early. And this time I told him. I could not take it. I hard trouble just moving from the bed to to bathroom.I was SEVERELY depressed to the point of suicidal thoughts. I slept 23 hours a day for five days. My tolerance was though the roof. I could take 80 mg in the morning just to feel ""normal."" Finally a doctor took mercy on me and cut my dose down to 20 mg a day with the explicit understanding my mother would be doling them out to me. I weaned off them gradually. Finally down to 5 mg a day. The withdrawals from this drug when it abused is nothing short of the definition of hell. Exhaustion is complete and total. You are NON FUNCTIONAL.  It's hard to give it a rating because my addictive mind abused the hell out of it. If you have any history of substance abuse STAY CLEAR! WORST DRUG I EVER ABUSED AND I DID JUST ABOTU ALL OF THEM!"

I was off meds for quite a while, but in my senior year of college, decided to try adderall.  Heard good things, and have noticed that it wakes me up almost like drinking a cup of coffee.  Definitely pay attention better, but I may up my dosage, as I am only on 25, where I was on 40 when i took ritalin.  The biggest thing i noticed though, was my lack of appetite.  I don't even think about food until at least midnight, depending on when i take the pill.  As of now I have only been on it for a couple weeks, and have lost 6lbs.  For me, that is an added bonus, but could pose problems later on and possibly malnutrition if I keep forgetting to eat.  Overall though, very satisfied."

I take it first thing in the morning and it works all day until late afternoon. The problem I had with other meds was having to REMEMBER to take the second dose in the afternoon because being ADD I have a tendency of not paying attention to the time too closely and would remember too late in the afternoon to ake any more if i wanted to get to sleep that night at a regular time. Taking Adderall XR takes that problem away making my life flow a little easier.

I take 30mg in the morning, then about an hour after lunch another 15mg and I'm good to go for the day and it usually doesn't effect my sleep unles I have something really bugging me then my mind has problems with wanting to over analyze it...but that's in check now.

However, since I have been on this drug I have experienced a lot of side effects ranging from no appetite, LACK of concentration and sense of time, sleeplessness (not what I need with apnea) weight loss and emotional episodes (such as sad commercials will make me cry), teeth grinding, and abdominal pain. Doctor is aware of the side effects and am going to try for a few more weeks before making any final decision as many med side effects fade for me over time. For what it has been prescribed for, as an anti-depressant/ stimulant, works great! But the side effects may just be too much."

My mood was much better, I could think crystal clear, and energy!!!  My house stayed SPOTLESS. But, after about a year of using it, the effects began to wear off. It became a typical narcotic.  The ""high"" would not last but a couple of hours and as I could feel the effects starting, I'd begin a bad mood because I knew it wouldn't last long.  Then, when I would ""crash"" it was Katie bar the door! I dared anyone to give me a reason to go postal. I suffered thru until this past February when they came out with Vyvanse.

The adderral worked wonderfully however sometimes my heart rate would be up. The worst side effect would be prolonged use and then when i would jsut stop for the weekend or summer etc. i would have terrible mood swings, and a loss of appetite all the time it seemed. But the drug did make a very ntoable difference and when it was well maintained and taken on a schedule it was a drug i would rate effective however iw ouldnt use it on younger children. "
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-14,adderall xr,Male,"Excellent drug that has helped me dramatically.  The trick is getting the dosage correct.  Too low of a dose kept me up for 24 hours, too high of a dose had me sleepy before noon.  With the correct dosage I sleep better than I have in years and can actually accomplish the things I need to get done.  As an adult I think it is great, but I can see how it could be difficult for a child to handle this medication.  I am not saying that I would not give it to a child, but I would be careful.  I am a 165lb, 38 yr old male and a 20mg xr dose is perfect for me. The medication works differently on everyone, but I could not imagine 60-90 mg daily. I am sure there are some that need it, but I would never give a child that kind of dose. Best of luck to you"

I have not however noticed any of the other symptoms like appetite changes or sleep inability.

Being a full-time student there is no down time when it comes to paying attention and my grades have gone from C's to B's I can remember material from lectures when I read I remember everything which has been so much easier on me. I'm not so hard on myself anymore because things come easier for me and I don't get frustrated and stress myself out.

I can get out of bed, I am more active than I have been in years. It's a life saver. A very good medicine. I feel alive for the first time in 10 years. The only downside is that it has increased my compulsiveness, or maybe it's just because I am alive again. I'm 55 and it have been an exhibitionist all my life. This med has increased my compulsion to expose myself again. But I had been almost asexual for 10-15 years. Now, since I am retired and don't have anything to do, my compulsive to do this is extreme. Went back into cunseling and stated SA meetings. Wtach for this type increase in compulsions."

Although with Paxil I am tired most of time. Started Adderall 10mg initiall and quickly went to Adderall XR 20, along with 10mg twice a day as needed. Has made a huge difference in my work life, allowing me to stay concentrated and alert. Now I believe I need to increase dose since I am not as alert as I was and also I have just recently went back to the Paxil from Lexapro. Make sure you are given the ADD/ADHD test if you have symptoms of tiredness and lack of concentration-it took my 47 years to find out I have ADD."

We increased the dose to 20mg and on thefirst day he had an extreme depresion and did not wanted to paly with anything, only wanted to seat in bed doing nothing and crying non-stop and his apetite was horrible, will not eat or drink anything at all.

I first started w/ ritilan and then to dexadrine and then to adderall and then to adderall xr when it came out. The majority of the yrs I was on adderall/adderall xr though. It helped me focus and get things done like it was supposed to but it made me not feel like myself. I was really quiet and reserved and just not myself when I would take it, so much that people would ask me if there was something wrong. I didn't realize that it made me feel that way so much until I graduated high school and stopped taking it all the time unless I needed it. I guess b/c I was constantly on it for so long that it didn't effect me as much, or it wasn;t as obvious til I stopped taking it.  I've taken it on and off when I needed it for 5yrs now until about 2 weeks ago I started on Focalin which seems to be working better.  In addition to lacking personality, adderall made me feel very depressed when I would come off of it."

I did okay in school. 3.4 GPA  now I am 22 and getting married and looking for a way to pay for the medication.  it's 3:20 AM. I read some of the other comments and found out I was not alone in that Others people who are on Adderall felt Emotionally hallow, soulless.

35-44,Other,2023-04-21,adderall xr,Female,"I have had depression my whole life. One of the side effects is the inability to focus and concentrate. My doctor gave me Addreall XR to help me with work since I was falling behind and losing jobs. Now Im doing better than I have in a long time. I can focus on things other than the negative stuff in my life, Im productive and confident I can get stuff done. All of this helped my overall mood since I had something positive in myself. However when my insurance ran out I stopped taking Adderall (its really expensive) and things went back to the way they were no matter how hard I tried to remain focused.


The only side effect I experienced was dry mouth...really dry.

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-13,adderall xr,Male,"I have always suffered from Depression and used Hyperactive Disorder to cover it up, thought to myself, ""If I just always had something to do, the depression would go away."" Then I had to have spine surgery and everything went down hill. If there is a place called rock bottom, I can get you there without a map. I was very athletic, and an all-state goalie for our local ice hockey team and had scholarships poaring in the mail for college. I got so depressed I would not want to wish that, the way I felt, on my worst enemy. About the only good thing was I picked up the guitar a friend bought me and it pretty much saved my life. That was almost 10yrs ago. I have been on Adderall for about 6 months now. I was always energetic but when my wife and I had our daughter I noticed a big change in my sleeping habbits, emotions, and ability to stay alert. When I was given Adderall, the first day, I just couldn't believe the difference. I'm sharper probubly more so then when I wasn't on it. I'm so energetic, positive, and just all together alot better off. The only side effect I have is sometimes I wish I had been put on it a long time ago. I'm due for another spine surgery, this time will be the third. I have Scoliosis, a sever case too. I have 3 curves in my spine. So, with the help of god, this time when they go in and take the rods that were put in on the second surgery and somehow snapped in half out. On top of all of this though I can still remain positive and focussed. I have to be, for my family. But if not for Adderall I don't even want to know where I'd be. "

It works great I went from having issues with work and keeping a job to being promoted with out even appling for the position.  I am able to concentrate and complete tasks easily.  The only down side is that it seems I start to develop a tolerance for it and have to have the does increased about every 2 years.  I have felt the tolerance build again and am going to have to increase the dose. I do have loss of appitite to the point I have put myself on an eating schedule so I remember to eat.

13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-09,adderall xr,Male,"I'm 18 and have been on Aderall since fifth or sixth grade i think i started at 5 or 10mg, now am at 35, i did a lot of growing. Any side effects i have had haven't bothered me and I never formed any habit or addictions to it. by tis I mean i very rarely take it during the summer or during weekends. I only take it when i need it. I cant recall ever feeling strande diffrent because of the medication either. Honestly i only realise how much i need it when i forget it. again i cant imagine id forget if i were addicted. I was never extremely hyper so i couldnt say how well it calms. I am also a sucsuessful artist and allways have been, i never have felt like it hinders my creativity or make me a zombie as it were. I have ADD, without the H but the squished the two together more recently i guess.  Seritonan is a chemical in your brain that is used among other things to block stimuli you don't need. this is why you don't feel your clothes after putting them on. I have a deficiency of it so it not inattention as much as, we try to pay attention to everything at once. witch is why during conversations my eyes dart around the room looking at everything, like the shiny stuff. I have been very happy with the medication, to the point where i may postpone increases in dosage in fear that they may decide i have too strong a tolerance and change it on me. I have been taking it long enough to have built confidence in the brand. I'm not sure if i will need it in college, only time will tell. the goal of course it to eventually no longer need the medication. I would recommend aderall but also have no experience with other medications."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-23,adderall xr,Female,I have seen a tremendous change from when we first started out and that was with Concerta. Switching over to Adderall stopped uncontrolable movements and twitches. My son who is 7 started to have more self control and has been able to socialize in a positive way. There are still lots to overcome but for the most part adderall has really helped to where we can now focus on teaching proper behavioral etiquette.
 ,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-02,adderall xr,Female,"My 9 year old son was diagnosed with ADD.  He was started on adderall xr 5mg  for 1 mo. then increased to 10mg.  It's been a total of 3mo. I think this is a perfect dose for him. We saw a difference the first day. He no longer ""daydreams""or have trouble understanding what people say to him (we had his hearing tested, EEG's etc..).  Homework went from 3-4 hrs. to 1-2hrs. and it's done correctly! Most of the time he's done it all before he gets home. His grades went from C's and D's to A's and B's in one marking period. The side effects I've noticed are dry mouth and sometimes he's irritable with his 6 year old sister and he used to be extremely tolerant (it actually seems more normal now). He's lost 4lbs but he can afford it because he was 77lbs. I was worried about the slow growth side effect, but he grew 1 in. since he started. I'm just not sure if I want him to take it during summer months or maybe I won't give it to him on the weekends.  This is something I'll discuss with his doctor.  It definetly works, it's just one of those things you wish you didn't have to do."

I'm able to concetrate better at work.  I'm doing traing for my other job, in school right now but this medication helps so much.  I've been getting 100% on all my test!  That never happens... I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for help with ADD.  It's great because you can tweek the dosage to find one that works for you."

I had no problem with that when i was younger,... but when i recently went back on adderall i notice that i go through withdrawls and have to take it everyday. I work in a dental office and ive noticed it has helped so much! I learned that in the years i went off adderall i developed coping skills with the condition, like id write lists of what i needed to do.

I didnt notice the side effects until i was a senior in high school. I have struggled with sleeping, relationships (due to the emotional effects i am overly sensitive and believe i have developed depression from it), loss of weight(especially earlier on, not so much now. kinda wish it was the other way around after being in college 3 years), cotton mouth, sexual side effects, and most of all dependency. when i tried going off the drug for a year the withdrawals were hard to deal with. i slept most of the day for about a month and gained  weight from increased appetite. after the withdrawals had finally ended, i felt happier and easier to be around. my relationships were great and my depression was gone. all side effects had disappeared. i felt more like myself off the drug. but my grades in school suffered. i got back on the dosage and all the old side effects came back. my grades improved, but i am back to the empty sole less feeling of a study drone. my current relationship is suffering and i dont sleep much. i will be on the drug until i graduate. as soon as i do, i will be saying goodbye forever to it. i love my parents and know they were trying to do the best thing for me. If i have kids one day, and they are diagnosed with ADD, i wont be putting them through the same hell i have suffered for the past decade. ADD has been around much longer than it has had a drug for it and most people seemed to have still lived a good life with out it(my dad for example). I would not recommend putting your kids on this drug early on in their lives. wait until they can fully understand the side effects of the drug and let them make the choice because this is a life changing decision that is extremely hard to revert back from. if your child is happy, isnt that the most important. im still scared what the long term effects of the drug will do to me down the road.

He started on 5 mg and when we moved him to 10 mg he was agitated for about 3 days.  It went away though.  I was concerned about growth, but for him he has grown 2 inches in the last 7 months.  The only down side was due to medicine and sports activities 5 days a week he hasn't gained a pound in those 7 months, but atleast he has grown taller.  I have to make him eat 3 times a day.  It's definately worth the results though as far as school goes!  I am very satisfied."
13-18,Other,2023-04-26,adderall xr,Female,"Adderall is a marvelous drug for those who truly have ADHD. It increases reaction time by 150%, along with attention and confidence. However, be advised against it if you are not sure of your symptoms. You will also experience sleeplessness, manic episodes, irritability, and decreased appetite if this drug is not for you.

At the time he started he was looking at repeating kindergarten and this medication helped eliminate that. By second grade (a year and half later) he was increased to 15mg but it didn't work out well for him. I believe he became immune to it and I had to change medications. Overall it was a great medication, no side effects with him at all and he was able to take it easily (either taking it apart and sprinkling on applesauce or oatmeal or swallowing whole pill).

My mom was afraid to put me on anything. She has since passed away from cancer and I decided to take charge and go to a doctor.

My doctor has been very, very friendly with me. He is a general practitioner and he always asks me how I am doing on it. When I began going to him, the dr asked me what I would recommend for the medicine for me to be on.

The first choice was Daytrana. I noticed nothing from that medicine.

Next was Ritalin SR 20. It worked..but gave me headaches.

Next try was adderall 10mg BID (Twice daily). It seemed to work, but my schedule didn't really allow me to keep taking it. I also didn't like bringing a C-2 drug to work.

So he asked me about adderall XR. I told him that it was worth a try, and since 10mg twice daily wasn't working, let's up it even more.

What a great decision!! Adderall XR 30mg once daily is working! I am now accepted more by my peers.

The only thing I don't like is the fact that I'm not as hungry anymore."

I recommend this drug, and also want to get it out there that it is possible to begin having ADD symptoms when you are an adult.

My son is 9 yrs old and was diagnosed with adhd. The doctor prescribed adderall xr 25 mg which is ok for his weight.  It was a nightmare.  The side effects were horrible.  My son was paranoid all day, aggitated, crying, hullisinating, anxiety, couldn't make decisions or stop talking.  It was the worst.  We took him to the emergency room and they couldn't do anything for him.  Just had to give him plenty of fluids.  It didn't wear off till 10:00 that night.  While in the hospital the dr told me another child two weeks ago had the same reaction.  I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.  It was a total nightmare.  And there was nothing i could do to help him."
 ,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-11,adderall xr, ,"This medication can have some serious side effects that aren't clearly stated in any of the literature. My 9 year old nephew developed a stomach ulcer after less than a year on this medication. 

Also, it has some wicked withdrawal symptoms if you discontinue it's use without weaning off. Causing symptoms typical of withdrawal such as anxiety, chills, sweating, vomiting and diarhea."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-12,adderall xr,Female,"I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 6 years old. I went thru lots of tests and many trips to the psychiatrist. (Can be very terrifying for a 6 year old)I started taking Ritalin for about 8 years. When I entered high school I started taking Adderall XR 20 mg. I love this medication. It’s very easy to take. I feel satisfied with my work ethic and I constantly have my eye on the ball. The only thing I find hard is, I have a problem with socializing while on the medication. It’s hard for me to have conversations that aren’t related to work. Guess you can say that I'm in the ZONE. (Not trying to freak any one out but is basically legal “speed”) I don't eat much either. I only take Adderall Monday-Friday. I used to take it everyday but I felt as if I were in a ""coma"" like state. Sometimes I'll forget to take my med. before work and what a HUGE difference I'm very sensitive, and I feel like I can eat a horse. My family, friends and co-workers know about my disorder. I don't feel embarrassed about it; it’s a part of me that I can’t control."
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-08,adderall xr,Female,"I was diagnosed ONE day before a consultant decided to change my job from interesting to  BOR-ing.  Hearing this, my Dr. decided to begin with one 30mg dose of AdderallXR first thing in the morning and 30mg at noon.  As I attempted to perform the boring tasks of my ""new"" job--anxiety increased so high it seemed I would snap in two--thus, I resigned.  

At this, my Dr. switched me to one 30mg XR and one generic non-extended release of 10mg at noon.  The anxiety lessened and I found I could focus on things like never before (the bad side is, sometimes I focus on things I DON'T NEED to do and hours pass as I search the web as I was doing just now).  

While on the 60mg XR, even though I experienced a heightened level of anxiety, I did an experiment and for the first time in my LIFE, I was actually able to make an outline, a REAL outline for a speech!  As a public speaker, this is pretty important.  

One strange side effect--before Adderall, I had stopped biting my nails and now I can't keep from chewing and ripping at them.  I have to glue on plastic nails to stop.  Also, I can't seem to fall asleep before about 1:30 AM, even if I take it at 7AM. But OFF of this drug, I used to feel lethargic almost all day and perk up at night, and on this dose, I have no more lethargy and I never nap at all during the day--I actually feel like a normal, thinking human being.  I wonder, what could be wrong with that, even if it IS addictive?  I'm not sure.  

Honestly, It's as if it connected those pieces of my 52 year-old brain that were never connected before...Adderall is not perfect--sometimes I have menopausal episodes of angst that are exacerbated by taking this stimulant, but even my husband noticed a marked change.  I am more ""real"" on this mind-assisting additive than not. 

Angst and nail-biting aside,  it's as if it has helped me find who I really am--helped my frontal lobe behave normally.  I don't want to go backward in processing information. It's so much better now... "
35-44,Other,2023-06-18,adderall xr,Female,"My daughter has been on this drug for almost a year.  While it has helped her focus on schoolwork, she has a huge problem getting to sleep before 11pm now.  She can be very moody and I'm now considering taking her to see a child psychologist.    She has lost a lot of weight since she's been taking it and her doctor wants to make sure she doesn't lose too much. She's only 10 years old.  This drug has certainly helped her with school and she's doing great, but I sometimes wish she wasn't so nasty to the rest of her family."
7-12,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-02,adderall xr,Male,I have three children that have used Adderall XR for ADHD. They all have done well but I now suspect that one of them is experiencing side effects to this medication.
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-29,adderall xr,Female,I was on Wellbutrin for 3 yrs and then started going to a therapist and he thought I had ADD so he put me on Vyvanse that worked pretty good but the copay for it was too high so he put me Adderall XR and I started feeling like I was losing my mind I couldn't remember anything so he took me off of that for good I'm going back on some antidepressants again hope I'll eventually get better!
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-25,adderall xr,Male,The first time I took this drug at 20mg.  I was bouncing off the walls.  Started grinding my teeth and poping my jaw.  Dr reduced to 10mg for about 2 weeks and then moved back up to 20mg.  That worked good.  I have a lot more patients.  I am not easily irated any more.  No road rage.  Problem now is I can't stop grinding my teeth and poping my jaw.  Drives me nuts.  Dr. tried moving up to 40mg a day but that gave me headaches.  I feel better on Adderall and willing to deal with the grinding and poping because I feel better overall.
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-21,adderall xr,Female,"Steady increase since 1998. XR help as the dips in drugs effectiveness and evening slump were intolerable. Nothing else worked. 20 mg XR did not last anylonger than not time release. Now up to 180 mg Adderall XR. I have no symptoms that I know of. To me, it seems too high a dosage. I don't talk to my Dr. for fear he'll lesson it. The effectiveness without dips is so wonderful. I've been on this dose for two and on half years."

35-44,Other,2023-05-07,adderall xr,Female,"I have MS and take Adderall 20mg XR for extreme fatigue.  I have to say it really helps with the fatigue.  I do often wonder if it is causing me to be extremely irritable, seems like since I have started taking it, my nerves are shot and I am anxious all the time.  Guess that is something I will have to discuss with my Neuro.  Overall for the fatigue it works very well."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-23,adderall xr,Female,"In the first four hours of taking this drug it's great. However, after that I often experience about one to two hours of what could be considered a ""coming down""--I want to just sit, not talk, and I feel sleepy."
 ,Other,2023-03-28,adderall xr, ,This medication has been a life saver for me. I have been taking it of the past 7 years of my life. I might have struggled w/ some abuse but I got help. I am able to remember things and concentrate. My world is a much better place!
45-54,Other,2023-04-21,adderall xr,Female,"I am using Adderall XR in combination with Prozac for depression.  The Prozac tends to make me lethargic, so the Adderall offsets that somewhat. I hate having to take one medicine to calm me down and another to perk me up, but I am feeling better and am more able to concentrate and get things done, so I guess overall I am improving on the medication."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-31,adderall xr,Female,"I've suffered from ADD for most of my schooling years, and adderall has really helped me. I only take it when I have class or need to study. I have trouble sleeping, but I did before anyway so I'm used to that. It has helped a lot with my anxiety, because it was caused from stress. It has helped me concentrate on everything I do. My thoughts are WAY more organized, and I don't have frequent bouts of confusion as I used to. I clearly understand anything being taught in class as opposed to before, and my grades have improved dramatically. College is not near as stressful as it used to be. It helps me relax, get organized, and feel in control of my life again."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-11,adderall xr,Male,"The first week with Adderall XR was horrible. Not being able to sleep because it kept me up all night. But it def. made me focus on just one task at a time and helped sort out everything in my head. Been taking it for two years maybe? Overall I'm satisfied. Only down side, just like any other medication, I forget to take it in the morning sometimes and have to run back home to take it."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-06-07,adderall xr,Female,"My experience with Adderall xr has been verry good but theres just a few side effects i can live with out like the dry mouth, caffine, and some times dizzyness but other than that its a verry good med"
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-13,adderall xr,Female,I cannot say enough about this incredible pill! I have been diagnoised with ADD for 8 years and it has absolutely changed my life! I'm taking the 20my XR everyday and it's just amazing. I'm able to focus on things and not feel like I'm just going through the motions each day. My work for both work and school are done well because I am able to concentrate more clearly when taking Adderall and because of that I can't help but feel good. I  would highly reccomend it to anyone!
13-18,Other,2023-04-17,adderall xr,Female,"I started taking this drug about a month ago and it has helped so much. I am on a medium dose(20mg) and it makes life so much easier. I used to be able to bs my way through school, but when i transfered to a private school, i finally realized i had a problem. Now, i get my hw done, i can concentrate more when in a class, and when someone is speaking to me, i am able to actually listen to what they are saying and not ""spacing out"" when they are talking. I also noticed a difference in standardized testing. I used to fidget alot and not be able to stay focus, but now they are a breeze for me. This drug has changed my life."

35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-28,adderall xr,Male,"20mg per day. alleviates symptoms of ADD. Cut out coffee so as to not interact with Adderall and SEVERE caffeine withdrawals that I initially attributed to the adderall. I was getting extremely fatigued in the afternoon. Crashing completely. One cup of coffee or about 100mg of caffeine fixed the problem. If you've been self-medicating you ADD with caffeine, be careful of withdrawals if you go of it while on adderall. withdrawals symptoms may or may not be headaches, might be fatigue, fuzziheadedness, inability to concentrate, sleepiness. As little as one 8oz cup of coffee or 25mg of caffeine can alleviate withdrawals. Adderall works great and lasts about 12 hours. I've been on it for 8 days."
35-44,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-13,adderall xr,Female,"My 7 yr. old son was diagnosed about 1 1/2 yrs. ago with ADHD. We started out with Concerta which worked for a month, but we never saw a great improvement with his symptoms. He has been on Adderall for over a year and fianally last month we reached peak satisfaction. This drug is great, but ADHD is a disease that you constantly have to monitor and keep in close contact with your health care provider. His dosage over a year has increased from 10-25 milligrams. So, if you are like me and expect that a miracle will occur and symtoms resolve after a short period of time, do not give up, things will gradually improve and then one day you look at your child and realize that he no longer has significant symptoms of ADHD. My son no longer gets in trouble at school and has been on the A honor roll for quite some time. Adderall has been a wonderful choice for my child."
19-24,Other,2023-05-27,adderall xr,Female,"I have been taking Adderall off and on for about 4 years. I can only take it for short periods though because i get insomnia really bad, headaches,loss of appetite, dry mouth, muscle aches, and i grind my teeth a lot. The main issue is the sleep deprivation though(notice it's 5 a.m. and I'm still awake). This medication does help me to pay attention in college especially when i have to pull all-nighters. I don't have ADHD but i do have problems focusing, however, my friends and i agree that this medication GIVES you ADD (or at least it feels like it) even if it does help you to concentrate. It will also make you talk your head off."
55-64,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-24,adderall xr,Female,"As an adult with ADD, this drug has worked very well in getting me to focus more easily and it keeps me that way.  My weight has remained stable and I have not felt any addiction symptoms.  I don't have to have it and can stop at any time.  Perhaps I simply do not have a tendency toward addiction."
55-64,Other,2023-01-20,adderall xr,Male,"I was being treated for depression, stress and anxiety.  Certain difficulties I was having led my psychiatrist to suggest I may have ADD (not hyperactive).  The adderall works (no doubt about that), but other elements of my day-to-day activities limited its effectiveness - I worked rotating shifts, variable lengths of time - that prevented me from developing a routine.  This was dealt with by adding adderall (immediately acting) to the XR (30 mgs each).  This seemed to work, until I changed jobs and ended up with a worse working enviroment.  Now unable to focus at all off work, overstress at work requires increased medication for depression et al. 
Adderall might be an excellent drug, but only if used in an environment where behavioral aspects of ADD can be addressed, as well."
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-19,adderall xr,Female,I was diagnosed with ADD in 3rd grade. I was put on Ritalin and it was not good for me. My parents took me off and thought I had been misdiagnosed. Fast Forward to college where I am struggling with my school work. One class in particular I am studying for days and getting D's. I was rediagnosed and given adderall. My grades improved from mostyl C's to A's and B's. A positive side effect: I would take it as soon as I got up in the morning and it made it easy for me to make it to early classes. I did experience dry mouth but it wasnt intolerable. Once in a while I would have trouble sleeping but some people say they sleep better on this because their thoughts dont race before bed. As for mood swings I didnt experience any. Some people might have said I wasn't as cheery but it was because I was so focused on getting something done I didnt have time to be distracted. I consider this a good thing. I did like the XR pills better. I have been off of my meds for 2 years and feel I should get back onto it for my job.
25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-03-06,adderall xr,Male,Adderall XR is a good med. it works good for me although i have to take a high dose because my focus and concentration is so bad. i am up to 60mg. i hope that i don't have to go above that in the future.
45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-05-14,adderall xr,Female,"My main concern with this medication has been my mouth being dry-since I am a ventriloquist- that is very unpleasant side effect. I lowered my dosage and that has helped -yet the drug gives me just the edge I need for extra concentration. I am able 
to sit still during meetings and contribute reather thatn be a distraction. "

He has either been on Honor Roll or High Honor Roll throughout 6-8grade and doing very well in High School. He is in 10th grade and can tell me when he needs to have an increase in medication.  My other son is in 5th grade and is doing very well also.  He was also diagnosed in 3rd grade.  He takes a 15 mg dose.  I can honestly say is has been a god send to have this medication. There is no longer the hours and hours spent on homework every night.  Or the constant yelling to ""Go do your homework!"""

13-18,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-02-13,adderall xr,Male,"This drug is sometimes referred to as a 'wonder drug' to those who have not used it for a long term. This drug ,though very helpful for my ADHD has caused me to have serious side effects from the past 3 years of use. I have now some little tics every now and then. There are little manic episodes associated with the drug. I even have depressive anxiety disorder because of this drug. Though this drug is great to solve a short term problem it should not be allowed to be used for longer terms. I am almost afraid to take it sometimes because I don't know what will happen. Also the mood swings because of the addictiveness of this drug are terrible. As I come off of it I become angry at almost everything. There is a reason it was banned in Canada."
19-24,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-10,adderall xr,Female,I like the fact this pill helps me concentrate and get work done and stay focused. I don't like that that I sometimes get restless and my wrist gets very irrated and I talk more on it.

In addition to ADHD-combination type, adult form, I also have depression and anxiety. I have tried numerous anti-depressants, with no lasting positive effects. Started AXR in Oct. 2006, and have since stopped all anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds. I can focus at work, and at school, and have far fewer problems with racing thoughts/random thoughts. I am able to function now. I did try Strattera, but found it only put me to sleep (up to 14 hours a day!), so I went back on the Adderall and will not switch again.

45-54,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-04-29,adderall xr,Female,"I have ADD, not ADHD.  I noticed a difference in my cognitive abilities almost immediately after using Adderall XR.  The 30 mg capsule made my heart race, so my dosage was reduced to 25 mg. The ideal dose for me would probably be somewhere in between 25 mg and 30 mg. My symptoms gradually worsened over a period of 30+ years and resulted in multiple job losses, divorces and financial difficulties.  I was not accurately diagnosed until age 45, although I had virtually all of the classic ADD symptoms dating back to childhood.  About 5 or 6 years ago I actually wondered if I had some type of learning disability because I could not process a complete thought, could not retain spoken information or instructions, was unable to concentrate on any task, etc. Although I discussed this concern with my psychiatrist at the time, there was no mention of the possibility of ADD.  I was given additional medication to treat my existing anxiety & depression, which did nothing to improve my ADD symptoms. However, on my first visit with a new psychiatrist several years later, I was given the diagnosis of ADD.  Of course, it would have been great to have been accurately diagnosed and treated years ago, but I am grateful to have found help at all.  I could have spent the rest of my life suffering if not for someone new taking a fresh look at my case."

25-34,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2023-01-12,adderall xr,Female,"As a child I was diagnosed with ADD.  I thought I grew out of it and wanted off the medication.  I am now in my mid 20's, just started a new job, which requires alot of concentration.  I was messing up all the time, and then decided to talk to my doctor about it.  She then prescribed me this medication, which after adjusting the dose, my boss and I have noticed a huge improvement.  The only things I don't like about it are, I love food and to eat.  I am underweight to begin with, and since being on addrell, I have lost about 10 more pounds.  I think I have gotten used to it, because I eat way better than the first few weeks of being on the meds. And the second thing is that I have had incressed mood swings in the mornings and evenings.  My husband and I fight like crazy now.  It doesn't matter how nice he is being, I take every thing the wrong way.  And since we both work the same hours, he never really sees me on them."
